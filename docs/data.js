        "text": "&emsp;&emsp;Netflix has been a lifesaver at a time like this. So many shows available to watch at all times of the day, all different genres, something for everyone. But now that production is starting back up after COVID delays, we might have to wait a while for the next season of Stranger Things or those long-awaited Marvel movies. So while we’re all waiting for the next big thing to hit the screen, I wanted to shine some light on those hidden gems all the way at the end of your Netflix list. <br>&emsp;&emsp;So if you like The Office (who doesn’t), go ahead and check out Parks & Recreation. Not entirely a hidden gem, but a severely underrated show in my opinion. Written by former Office writer and producer, Micheal Schur, the show has the same charm and hilarity as its predecessor. Parks & Rec follows the Pawnee, Indiana Parks & Recreation Department run by the stoic, but hilarious, Ron Swanson and the slightly annoying and determined Leslie Knope. Knope leads the show through her daily life of trying to turn a giant pit into a beautiful park, with many detours including people falling in the pit, concerts by Pawnee favorite, Mouse Rat, and government shutdowns. Andy Dwyer, lovable, crazy, utterly stupid, is one of the shining stars in the show’s larger ensemble of characters. The things that fall out of his mouth will have you on the floor because of just how ridiculous they are. If you can make it through the slow-moving first season, you won’t regret binging this NBC comedy over the course of the next few days. (All seven seasons available now on Netflix)<br>&emsp;&emsp;If you binged Tiger King in two days like I did and were fascinated by how Joe Exotic made it so far without ending up in prison, you might enjoy HBO’s McMillions. Remember those Mcdonald’s Monopoly peel-off games? The ones you would keep getting free small Cokes from? So apparently, an ex-cop rigged the games for years, stealing millions of dollars with the help of people from all over the country. This 6-part docuseries breaks down how he did it and how he was caught in the process. In my opinion, sometimes documentaries and real stories that are dramatized are more immersive than fiction itself and McMillions is a show that proves it. As you watch this show, you will think to yourself “there’s no way that he got any with that, right?” and then he DOES. It was definitely worth watching because now I know how to scam a global conglomerate out of millions. Thanks, Uncle Jerry! (All six episodes available on HBO/HBO Max)<br>&emsp;&emsp;Finally, if you watched any teen Netflix movie that they have put out in the past year, (The Kissing Booth 2, To All The Boys I’ve Ever Loved 2, etc.) please please PLEASE go watch Netflix’s The Half Of It. I loved this movie, it gave me a very grounded high-school, coming of age film experience in the way these big-budget Kissing Booths can’t. The movie follows Ellie Chu, a typical high school student who juggles taking care of her father, keeping her grades up, and running an illegal underground essay-writing ring within her small-town school. In comes Paul Munsky, a tall, awkward, nice guy who has a giant crush on a popular girl, Aster Flores. Paul asks Ellie to help him write Aster love letters, but then surprise-surprise things don’t go to plan and it all spirals out of their control. The story is predictable in the way most Netflix movies are, but the writing in this movie is so natural and smooth, unlike so many of the cringy Netflix movies we all flock to. I have to say it even though most people won’t really notice, but the cinematography and imagery/motifs in this film are amazing. It feels as if the movie was adapted from a best-selling book, but it is an original screenplay written and directed by Alice Wu, veteran writer, and director within the film community. I highly suggest watching this movie and really listening to what it is saying, as I believe there is something everyone can take from the experience. (Available on Netflix now)<br>&emsp;&emsp;Honorable mention is definitely Schitt’s Creek from Pop TV. All of it is on Hulu right now and it is hilarious. Ever wanted to watch rich people lose all their money and live in a rickety old motel in a small town? I know it doesn’t sound like much, but that is the best part. It’s not too complicated and the jokes still put me on the floor. I only learn my new vocabulary words from the queen herself, Moira Rose. Seriously go watch it. (All six seasons on Hulu)"

        "text": "&emsp;&emsp;Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation, Inc. is a global organization in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada. In response to the acquittal of Treyvon Martin’s murderer, George Zimmerman, in 2013 Alicia Garza, Patrisse Cullors, and Opal Tometi united to form a Black-Centered political will and project named #BlackLivesMatter. Now, seven years later, there has been a resurgence of the Black Lives Matter movement after the deaths of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor. It is important to note that the mission of the Black Lives Matter organization  “is to eradicate white supremacy and build local power to intervene in violence inflicted on Black communities by the state and vigilantes.” This is important because the media commonly associates the atrocities of police brutality with this organization; although according to their mission Black Lives Matter they would intervene in violence inflicted upon their community, they also advocate for other aspects of violence and oppression against the Black community to stop. By combating acts of violence against the Black community, and creating space for Black imagination and innovation the organization is making immediate improvements for Black people. <br>&emsp;&emsp;Black Lives Matter believes that in order to effectively achieve their goal they must unite and “move beyond the narrow nationalism that is all too prevalent in Black communities. We must ensure we are building a movement that brings all of us to the front.” This organization aims to help all members of the Black community which includes Black queer and transgender people, Black disabled people, undocumented Black people, Black people with records, Black women, and Black Lives all across the gender spectrum. By helping all individuals within this community, they are striving for “a world where Black lives are no longer systematically targeted for demise.” This is a rallying call for all black lives that strive for liberation.<br>The quoted information and more about the organization can be found at blacklivesmatter.com. <br><br>MLA Citations:<br>&emsp;&emsp;“About .” Black Lives Matter, 22 June 2020, blacklivesmatter.com/. <br>&emsp;&emsp;“Her Story .” Black Lives Matter, 22 June 2020, blacklivesmatter.com/. <br>"

        "text": "&emsp;&emsp;The sports industry has taken more hits this year than Brett Farve has had at quarterback in his entire career, and that is saying a lot. COVID-19 has posed many challenges to the sports industry such as player safety, spectator safety, and economic concerns. For a long time, sports fans were left wondering if any of their favorite sports would return. Then, in March the sports world officially shut down and sports fans threw in their towel on their aspirations for the return of sports. However, now enough time has passed and leagues have had ample time to discuss their plans for their current or upcoming seasons. <br>&emsp;&emsp;Perhaps one of the most blind-siding returns to sports was announced by the National Basketball Association. After a near 5 month hiatus, the NBA announced it will officially return at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex inside Disney World in Orlando, Florida. The players are residing in a place commonly referred to as “The Bubble.” Here, they are served food and can even get a haircut but they are not allowed to leave. Due to strict quarantine rules, the league decided on an 8 game regular season played by the top 22 teams in the NBA with no spectators. The season began on July 30th with a game between the Utah Jazz and the New Orleans Pelicans ending with a Jazz win (106-104).<br>&emsp;&emsp;One of the most controversial returns to sports was announced by Major League Baseball earlier this month. A 2020 MLB season was looking dismal for a while as many of the MLB representatives and the Major League Players Association representatives could not come to an agreement on anything regarding the return of baseball. Fortunately for baseball fans, the MLB announced a 60-game season for 2020 followed by the compliance of the MLBPA. The season began on July 23rd, with no spectators and a game in Washington virus the New York Yankees. Garret Cole claimed his first win as a New York Yankee defeating the Washington Nationals 4-1 despite getting rained out after six innings. <br>&emsp;&emsp;To continue safe play in the return of these leagues, organizations should look to the NWSL Challenge Cup. Started in late June, the National Womens’ Soccer League was the first US sport to come back after COVID-19 canceled seasons in March 2020. The 23-match tournament in Utah, took a similar approach to the NBA Bubble, containing players in what was known as the “NWSL Village”, just outside of Salt Lake City. All players and staffers were tested before transitioning to Utah and throughout the tournament. Due to this initial test, the Orlando Pride was to sit out of the tournament due to several positive tests from both team members and staff, which later turned out to be false-positives. With regular testing and strict protocols throughout the tournament, the Houston Dash won the Challenge Cup and the bubble remained COVID free for the entire month. Streamed daily from both Twitch and CBS All Access, the Challenge Cup proved to be a great return for US Sports post-COVID break and another great stride for the popularity of women’s sports in the US. The finals between Houston Dash and the Chicago Red Stars amassed a viewership of 653,000 during the CBS-streamed final, which dwarfed the 572,000 viewers of the Challenge Cup opener between North Carolina Courage and the Portland Thorns.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Some organizations such as the National Football League are hopeful for a 2020 season. The NFL and the NFL Players Association have agreed upon all outstanding items necessary to start training camp on time from a health and economic standpoint. Will there be a 2020 NFL season? Players and fans can only hope."

        "text": "&emsp;&emsp;“The more you know, the more you realize you don’t know” is a quotation that has been passed through word of mouth, through books, and across the internet time and time again.  It has been credited to Albert Einstein, Laozi, Aristotle, and many others, but while its exact source may be unknown without some lengthy research into philosophy, the point remains abundantly clear.  As knowledge is gained, one’s horizons expand, and more unknown information can be found just out of reach.  The quotation is usually brought up to show that people should not feel thwarted by the fact that they will never be able to know everything.  The problem is that, not only do people’s horizons expand, but people actively lose knowledge over time.  <br>&emsp;&emsp;In the 1940s, a teacher named Edgar Dale miraculously produced knowledge of neuroscience that would not be understood until years later.  His “Cone of Experience” was a pyramid that showed the amount of knowledge retained from various methods, showing that, for example, writing or doing something allows that writer or doer to retain more knowledge than if they had simply heard the knowledge.  Dale’s original cone, of course, was rapidly spread, misinterpreted, and changed.  Newer versions of the cone that come with exact percentages of how much information is retained are baseless, and even the original work was not exactly correct, but it gets the job done.  For the majority of people, the cone is relatively correct.  <br>&emsp;&emsp;Of course, if the exact percentages seen on later, incorrect versions of the cone are not to be trusted, then the cone does not explain that much.  It clearly shows that people do not retain all the information that is thrown at them, because those people certainly do not spend the time to think about how exactly they need to remember it, however, it does not show how much information anybody is really losing.  According to Daniel Willingham, a member of the American Federation of Teachers who pulled studies about knowledge retention from various scientific papers in order to get to the bottom of the mystery, roughly 50% of knowledge about any topic can be lost after three years without learning about that specific topic.  After three years, even more than 50% of knowledge is lost, at a frighteningly fast rate.  <br>&emsp;&emsp;Initially, this information might seem absolutely atrocious.  How pointless everything must be if everyone only remembers 50% of a given topic, right?  Not quite.  The bad news is that someone who learned about a specific topic, algebra, for example, and then spent three years not thinking about algebra at all would lose 50% of the information, but it gets better.  Studies found that if a student takes algebra and then continues to higher-level course work, like, trigonometry, geometry, or calculus, while that higher-level knowledge is lost at a fast rate, knowledge of algebra is lost at a much, much slower rate.  This does not only apply for math, but for any topic where information can be built upon prior knowledge.  Revisiting ideas over long periods of time can cement those ideas in one’s mind, and stop 50% of it from vanishing.  Studies also show that while information may seem lost, it is usually more easy to relearn information that is lost than it was originally.  This means that 50% of knowledge is not lost forever, just a little bit difficult to find again.  <br>&emsp;&emsp;This article may be part of the knowledge that readers will fail to retain, but hopefully it inspires some to actively review what they have learned to keep their hard-earned knowledge. Information used to write this article came from www.aft.org/ae/fall2015/willingham, which can be viewed for further information on the subject of knowledge retention.  Never stop learning."

        "text": "&emsp;&emsp;So you have some questions about college I hear... well, luckily, I have some answers! There are countless confusing aspects of the college admissions process but trust me, we’ve got this! To start shedding some light on questions everyone may have... here are some answers to the questions asked on our Instagram poll (follow us @chs. newspaper)! <br><b>How can we prepare early with classes so that we don’t need to take them in college?</b> <br>&emsp;&emsp;There are plenty of classes offered at Columbia that are worth college credit! Most AP and University in the High School classes are worth 1-3 college credits. 1 college credit is worth a one-semester class and 3 college credits are worth a full-year class. By taking these classes (such as Spanish 4 with Mrs.Leforeister, Intro to Psychology with Mr.Lapolla, or any AP science, English, math, or history courses) you will gain credits that will transfer for your freshman year in college (so you won’t have to take these classes your first year)! However, some colleges do not accept credits gained in high school so it is extremely important that you research what credits the colleges you are looking at will take. Your guidance counselor can give a full list of courses offered in CHS that are worth college credits. <br><b>If we know where we want to go, what should we be focusing on the most right now?</b> <br>&emsp;&emsp;College essay. College essay. College essay. Your college essay is the one part of your application that lets your personality shine through. By having a super solid essay your chances of getting into the college of your choice significantly rise since it will set you above other applicants. Another helpful thing to do is to research the college’s policies. Whether it be transfer policies, study abroad options, financial aid, etc., make sure you look into every aspect of that college and meet all the requirements for their application. Lastly, scholarships are key. Replace that time in which you would’ve been visiting other colleges by applying for scholarships. Apply to as many scholarships as humanly possible to save some cash in the long run ;). You can reach out to your guidance counselor for lists of scholarships and they are also posted on your Naviance account. <br><b>Will we be able to visit colleges?</b> <br>&emsp;&emsp;As of right now, almost all schools are doing virtual tours and some schools are doing in-person. If you are interested in visiting a college, their visiting/touring policy will be posted on their website! Is it okay if you don’t know what you want to major in while looking at colleges? YES! Trust me, I’m applying to colleges in two months and I still don’t know what I’m going to major in. Most (if not all) colleges let you enter as undecided and you don’t have to declare a major for at least a year. If you are unsure of your major, colleges like to let you get a feel for which classes you like before setting down one track and you are also even able to change your major (multiple times!) so there is ZERO pressure if you don’t know what you’d like to major in yet! <br><b>Stay tuned for more questions and polls on our Instagram!</b>"

        "text": "&emsp;&emsp;It was a brisk autumn night; the smell of warm, toasted marshmallows lingered in the air. To my left, a raging five-foot-tall bonfire towered beside me, lighting up the whole site. To my right was vast darkness for which I could not make sense of. I walked to the wooden table where my friends were seated and for a while and just chatted; we talked about our embarrassing stories in which no one wanted to share but we did it anyway. Time flew by and before I knew it, I got a text from my dad saying he was on his way to pick me up. We started to clean up our mess when one of my friends had the bright idea to take my phone and attempt to open it. Little did she realize that her phone was just sitting on the table, out in the open, so I decided that two could play at that game. For some odd reason,  as soon as her phone was taken, she immediately became very defensive, like an animal whose child had just been stolen. I made a run for it, bolting in the darkness through uneven dirt and piles of leaves. <br>&emsp;&emsp;As I was running for my life, I had encountered an obstacle and the next thing I knew I was on the ground covered in dirt. It wasn’t until I looked up that I had realized that I had driven my shin into the corner of a disgustingly old stone bench which tore my skin open. Naturally, everyone came running towards me and helped me clean out the cut. Of course, I was upset, but at the time, I thought it was just a minor cut and it would probably heal in a week. I remained calm, wrapped up my wound, and walked on my wounded leg all the way to the driveway to where my dad was waiting. <br>&emsp;&emsp;As we drove home, I assured him it was just a minor mishap and told him not to worry. As soon as I got home, I headed to the bathroom to clean out the wound a little more. When I took the bandage off, I viewed the monstrosity that was now my left leg. The cut had gone deeper than I had thought and was now not leaking, but squirting out blood with pressure. Along with that, the top layer of skin in a 2-inch radius of the cut was skinned off. I began to get a little more unsettled but not to the point in which I was panicking. I attempted to apply pressure on the wound, but the blood kept leaking through like a water-fall. My dad knocked on the door and asked if everything was ok. “I’m fine,” I replied. <i>I lied</i>. I was definitely <i>not</i> fine. I must’ve gone through a whole roll of bounty when I made the decision to just try to sleep. I slept with my wound pointed upwards with the fan on high in an attempt to clot the blood: a simple yet effective trick I had learned through many years of falling off of bikes, rocks, and many more. However, my efforts were no match for the power of my circulatory system and my leg had leaked blood all night. <br>&emsp;&emsp;When I woke up, the white towel that I had strategically placed under my leg was stained red. It was then that my mother had walked into the room and began to frantically panic in shock. She wanted to take me to the ER but my dad insisted that we go to my physician instead. It was a painful walk, trying to get down the stairs and into the car but I managed to do it. My physician said that stitches were not an option since the wound was so weirdly cut open. He just gave me some prescription antibiotics and sent me along my way. Well, that didn’t help. I was still bleeding, so I decided to just wrap up my leg and cut off the blood circulation to try to calm it down. <br>&emsp;&emsp;The days following that, the pain in my leg started to get worse and worse, until it was at the point where I couldn’t even stand up. I was rushed to the ER and was greeted by 3 tall white men who looked like they were fresh out of med school. They put me in a bed, (which was surprisingly comfortable) asked me a few questions, and examined my leg. An hour went by as I was just instructed to sit there in the bleak room with absolutely nothing to do. They ran a few tests and came back with some news. “Not gonna lie to you kid… we have no idea what’s going on.” They wanted me to get a few x-rays done so that they could get a better look at my leg and thus began my extravagant journey across the hospital and to the x-ray room. When my bed was waiting in line, I overheard the guy in front of me talking with one of the doctors. “Chainsaw...accident…” I looked over to see what had happened to him and to my surprise, he had nearly cut his whole leg off from what I believe was a chainsaw accident which made my open wound look like a scratch. <br>&emsp;&emsp;The x-ray table was cold and hard, and every second that I had to keep my leg up felt like it was getting stabbed in the shin over and over again. They took the x-rays, wheeled me back to my room, and then proceeded to wait another two hours before actually telling me that the bench had gone through my skin and straight into the bone, fracturing it. I was finally relieved that I now had a clear sense of what had happened and a logical explanation for the amount of pain I was in. I was discharged, sent back home and took a few days off as the doctor had said. I was forced to take these green pills that tasted like literal vomit (and made me want to puke) so that the bone wouldn’t get infected. It took almost 3 whole weeks before I was back on my two feet again and was ready to get back in the routine. Looking back at that whole experience, I wonder how things would’ve gone differently if I had just gone straight to the ER. Would it have saved me from a lot of pain? Probably. But the truth is, no one will ever know. For if I had known what lies underneath, it definitely wouldn’t have been the same."

        "text": "&emsp;&emsp;The holiday season is right around the corner, and guess what that means; holiday baking! Thanksgiving is coming at a rapid rate, so why not start thinking about all the delicious and life-changing sweet treats you can bring into your home with few ingredients to ensure 100% satisfaction. When I think of fall and holiday baking, my mind automatically rushes to warm, crisp, and gooey desserts such as pies, bread, and the arguable best dessert ever; cookies! In this writing piece, I will introduce to you a few of my personal best-selling fall/holiday desserts from my own small business bakeshop.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Let’s start with pies. The first pie that comes to my mind when I think of the upcoming seasons is the classic apple pie. This recipe is not just a simple apple pie, instead, it combines an impeccable cinnamon sugar crumble atop fresh, soft cinnamon-infused apples. This recipe will not disappoint and is guaranteed to be a staple at your next Thanksgiving dinner.  <br><br>For this recipe you will need:<br><b>Filling</b><br>&emsp;• 3 ¼ pounds Granny Smith apples, peeled, cored, sliced ¼ inch thick<br>&emsp;• ⅔ cup sugar<br>&emsp;• 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour<br>&emsp;• 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon<br>&emsp;• 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted<br><b>Topping</b> <br>&emsp;• 1 cup all-purpose flour<br>&emsp;• ½ cup granulated sugar<br>&emsp;• ¼ cup (packed) golden brown sugar<br>&emsp;• 1 ½ teaspoons ground cinnamon<br>&emsp;• ½ teaspoon salt<br>&emsp;• 6 tablespoons chilled unsalted butter, cut into ½ -inch cubes <br><b>Crust</b><br>&emsp;• Store bought Pillsbury pie crust <br><br>Directions: <br><b>For the filling</b>, mix all the ingredients in a large bowl to coat apples. <br><b>For the topping</b>, blend the first 5 ingredients in a food processor. If you do not have a food processor, a blender will work just fine. Add chilled butter cubes; using on/off turns (starting and stopping the processor or blender) and continue until the mixture resembles a wet sand-like consistency.<br><b>Assembly</b>, Toss your filling to redistribute juices; transfer to crust; mounding in the center. Pack your topping over and around apples. Bake pie on a baking sheet at 400 degrees F, until topping is golden, about 40 minutes on the middle rack of the oven (cover the top with foil if the pie is browning too quickly). Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F. Bake until apples in the center are tender when pierced and filling is bubbling thick around the edges, about 45 minutes longer. Cool until warm, and serve with a dollop of vanilla ice cream for the perfect dessert! <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;Now, I know I said that the pie was easy, but I’ll admit; It can be challenging and time-consuming, but I promise that it will be worth it in the end. Moving on to an easier delightful dessert, I think it is only appropriate for me to introduce the best ever fall quick-bread to you; pumpkin swirl chocolate chip bread. This is a “quickbread” meaning it does not require any yeast. I have a couple of tips and tricks on how you can make this bread out of this world! Tip number one is to use pumpkin butter. Using pumpkin butter will ensure a richer, deeper pumpkin flavor. This ingredient is hard to find though, so using all pumpkin puree will work just fine. Tip number two is to not be afraid of adding a little more chocolate chips. The chocolate in this recipe really brings it above and beyond. Lastly, make sure to sprinkle extra cinnamon sugar atop your bread for an extra sweet kick. To recap, this bread is super easy to make, full of actual pumpkin flavor, swirled with cinnamon sugar, studded with chocolate chips galore, and finished with a crisp cinnamon-sugar top. <br><br>Now that I have basically given you no reason to pass on making this recipe, you will need: <br>&emsp;• ½ cup pumpkin butter (or puree if butter is not available) <br>&emsp;• ½ cup pumpkin puree<br>&emsp;• ½ cup melted salted butter<br>&emsp;• ½ cup pure maple syrup<br>&emsp;• 2 large eggs at room temperature<br>&emsp;• 2 teaspoons vanilla extract<br>&emsp;• 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour<br>&emsp;• 2 teaspoons baking powder<br>&emsp;• ½ teaspoon baking soda<br>&emsp;• ½ teaspoon plus one tablespoon ground cinnamon<br>&emsp;• ¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg<br>&emsp;• ¼ teaspoon ground ginger<br>&emsp;• ¼ teaspoon ground cloves<br>&emsp;• ½ teaspoon kosher salt<br>&emsp;• ½ cup semi-sweet or milk chocolate chips <br>&emsp;• ½ cup granulated sugar<br><br>Directions: <br>&emsp;1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease and flour (9x5) bread pan<br>&emsp;2. In a large bowl, stir together the pumpkin butter, pumpkin puree, melted butter, maple syrup, eggs, and vanilla extract until combined. Add the flour, baking powder, baking soda, ½ teaspoon cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, cloves, and salt, mix until just combined. Fold in the chocolate chips. <br>&emsp;3. In a bowl, combine the granulated sugar with the remaining 1 tablespoon of cinnamon.<br>&emsp;4. Spoon half of the pumpkin batter into the prepared pan. Sprinkle with the cinnamon sugar, reserving 2 tablespoons of sugar for topping the loaf. Add the remaining batter over the sugar. Run a knife down the center of the loaf 1-2 times to gently swirl the sugar. Sprinkle cinnamon sugar over the top of the batter.<br>&emsp;5. Transfer to the oven and bake for 55-60 minutes or until the center is just set. <br>&emsp;6. Remove the bread and let cool for at least 30 minutes before cutting. <br><br>&emsp;Let’s be real; Thanksgiving dinner will leave you stuffed….. But there is always still room for the perfect cookie! Especially a cookie that is ultra-soft and festive like this one! So, without further ado, let me introduce you to the white chocolate cranberry cookie! Be prepared to devour the whole batch once you taste this masterpiece in your mouth. This cookie has a classic chocolate chip cookie base but has added cranberries to give a tangy touch. You are probably wondering, what’s the secret to this irresistible cookie? Cornstarch! Yes, cornstarch. This will guarantee your cookies to be soft, thick, and chewy. Think about it as a thickening agent, cornstarch gives thick glazes, pie fillings, and so much more. Now enough of me talking, and let’s get into this recipe! <br><br>You will need:<br>&emsp;• ¾ cups unsalted butter softened to room temperature  <br>&emsp;• ¾ cup packed dark brown sugar<br>&emsp;• 1 large egg<br>&emsp;• 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract<br>&emsp;• 2 cups all-purpose flour<br>&emsp;• 2 teaspoons cornstarch<br>&emsp;• 1 teaspoon baking soda<br>&emsp;• ½ teaspoon salt<br>&emsp;• ¾ cup white chocolate chips<br>&emsp;• ¾ cup dried cranberries<br><br>Directions: <br>&emsp;1. In a large bowl using a hand mixer or stand mixer, beat the butter for 1 minute on medium speed until completely smooth and creamy. <br>&emsp;2. Add the brown sugar and granulated sugar and mix on medium speed until fluffy and light in color. Beat in the eggs and vanilla on high speed. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed.<br>&emsp;3. In a separate bowl, whisk the flour, cornstarch, baking soda, and salt together until combined. On low speed, slowly mix into the wet ingredients until combined. The cookie dough will be quite thick. Add the white chocolate chips and dried cranberries then mix on low for about 5-10 seconds until evenly incorporated. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours and up to 2 days. Chilling is mandatory for this recipe.<br>&emsp;4. Remove cookie dough from the refrigerator and allow to sit at room temperature for 10 minutes. This makes the cookies easier to scoop and roll.<br> &emsp;5. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. Set aside.<br>&emsp;. Once chilled, the dough will be slightly crumbly. Work the dough through your hands and roll into individual balls about 1 heaping tablespoon. Place 10-13 cookies on the prepared baking sheet and bake for 10-11 minutes. They will look extremely soft, so make sure to not overbake. Allow to cool for 5 minutes on the hot pan, and then transfer to a cooling rack to cool completely. That’s it!  Now all that’s left to do is enjoy this delicious melody in your mouth!"

        "text": "&emsp;&emsp;Like the feeling of being wrapped in a cozy warm scarf brings the taste of fresh out of the oven, hot apple pie, or the first pumpkin spice anything of the season, what's not to love about fall?

Whether it be forever, fringe, ruffle blouses, or the hot new puff sleeve, all can be found on the runways for the 2020 season. This year clothing in neutrals are in high demand. Browns and beiges are the new go-to colors for fall. Neutrals can be worn head to toe or with a pop of color to make you stand out. To accessorize you will want silver, gold, and bronze, which are the hottest use for fall. Remember, less is more this season. A few must-have essential statement pieces will help transform your wardrobe. Shop statement coats, everyday accessories, and cold weather must-haves for layering. Lastly, collared shirts under sweatshirts are making a comeback! Style a plain collared button-up, under your favorite pullover/crewneck sweatshirt. This provides layering, but also a classic and casual contrast. Shopping on a budget?  No problem, we've got you covered. Here are a few go-to shops for trendy styles on a budget. These essentials just make good cents! <br>&emsp;• Shein - New in Fall & Winter Clothing<br>&emsp;• Fashion Nova - New Arrivals, Trending<br>&emsp;• Forever 21 - New Arrivals<br>&emsp;• Rue21 - Search “Fall” and/or “Winter”<br><br>&emsp;&emsp;Once you’ve got your wardrobe essentials in place, it’s now time to start thinking about completing your look with the right fall makeup. Artist eyes and gothic glamour are the hottest trends for 2020. Explore delicate face decals adorned with crystal embellishments to enhance an easy glow high shine cheekbone look. Get artsy with extra eyeliner and over liner looks.

What better way to step into fall with a brand new pair of trend-approved shoes! As things are opening up and we are finally coming out of our homes, and getting out of our old slippers, we need to add the perfect shiny new pair of shoes. I have scoured the runways for the latest, and most desirable shoe trends for this new Fall and Winter season. From Prada designs to Target dupes, I have the right selection of shoes just for you. Let’s start with Wellies. These are by far the most practical of shoe trends this fall. This design of a boot is waterproof, cozy, and fit for all styles. They were seen on the runway by Prada but can be found for a fraction of the price. Check websites such as <i>everlane.com</i>, <i>nordstrom.com</i>, and <i>bloomingdales.com</i>. Simply search “Wellies” in the search bar on each website. Next, we have the OTK Boot. This over the knee boot was all over the runway, and seriously; what’s not to like! This boot style will never go out of style with the glossy finish and gathers all up the leg. Find these boots on websites such as <i>dsw.com</i>, <i>modaoperandi.com</i>, and <i>zappos.com</i>. These boots can vary quite a bit in price, so I have listed options for high-end shoes, as well as affordable chic options. For the final Fall shoe trend that is taking over social media, we have the rhinestone embellished shoe category. This is by far my favorite trend of the season. These shoes have been all over the runway, but are not going out of style any time soon. Find rhinestone embellished shoes on websites such as <i>shopshop.com</i>, <i>bloomindales.com</i>, and <i>stevemadden.com<i>. With all of this fabulous Fall Fashion information, you have all the resources you need to make the best, new ensemble from head to toe.

        "text": "&emsp;&emsp;2020 has been a crazy year. With a pandemic, racial injustice, and an election, this year has already been shocking and difficult. Along with our world being turned upside down, we had to deal with celebrity deaths. It’s just the icing on the top of the cake this year. Only that icing turns out to be lard. Here are just some impactful people that have passed away this year. <br>&emsp;&emsp;One celebrity that has passed is Naya Rivera. She was born on January 12, 1987, and lived to July 8, 2020 (33). She passed away from accidental drowning in Lake Piru, CA. She was declared missing on July 8 and found on July 13, 2020, the 7th anniversary of the death of her Glee co-star, Cory Monteith. She was on a boating trip with her son when she was discovered missing when the boat was not returned during its allotted time. Her son is still alive and living full time with her ex-husband, Ryan Dorsey. She is best known for her role in Glee as Santana Lopez, a queer, Latina teenager, and the role was unique at the time it first aired. Many friends and costars tweeted or posted on Instagram, originally in hope that she would defy the odds and be found, but then in loving memory. Demi Lovato wrote “RIP Naya Rivera. I’ll forever cherish the opportunity to play your girlfriend on Glee. The character you played was groundbreaking for tons of closeted queer girls (like me at the time) and open queer girls, and your ambition and accomplishments were inspiring to Latina women all over the world. My heart goes out to your loved ones at this time.” <br>&emsp;&emsp;Two more celebrities that perished this year are Kobe and Gianna Bryant. Kobe Bryant was born on August 23, 1978, and lived until January 26, 2020 (41). He died in a helicopter crash in CA with his daughter Gianna Bryant (May 1, 2006 - January 26, 2020; 13) along with 7 others on their way to a youth basketball tournament. The pilot had no drugs or alcohol in his system. Kobe Byant was a shooting guard and spent the entirety of his career with the LA Lakers He won 5 NBA championships, an MVP award, made 18 All-Star teams, won two Olympic Gold Medals, and finished with 33,643 points. Gianna was also a basketball player, and her jersey number was retired at her middle school. Unfortunately, Vannessa Byrant (wife and mother, respectively) learned of the crash from social media or TMZ, as they leaked the news before authorities could contact her. She is now in the middle of a lawsuit for pictures taken at the place of the crash, that were insensitive and her lawsuit includes claims of negligence, invasion of privacy, along with intentional infliction of emotional distress. On what would have been his 42nd birthday, she posted “Happy birthday. I love you and miss you more than I can ever explain. I wish you and Gigi were here to celebrate YOU...Our lives feel so empty without you and Gigi. I’ve been completely broken inside...I wish I could wake up from this nightmare...I’m mad I didn’t go first...I love you now, forever, and always.” <br>&emsp;&emsp;Another celebrity that we have lost this year is Chadwick Boseman. He was born on November 29, 1976, and lived to August 28, 2020 (43). He passed from stage IV colon cancer after being diagnosed 4 years prior (it began at stage III and progressed). His diagnosis became public as his cause of death, although some fans raised health concerns seeing his extreme weight loss. He was best known for playing Jackie Robinson in the biographical film 42, and as T’Challa/Black Panther in several Marvel films. The film Black Panther was the first superhero film nominated for best picture at the Oscars. There were many tweets from coworkers and friends in regard to his passing, but one from Obama read “Chadwick came to the White House to work with kids when he was playing Jackie Robinson. You could tell right away that he was blessed. To be young, gifted, and Black; to use that power to give them heroes to look up to; to do it all while in pain – what a use of his years.” <br>&emsp;&emsp;In addition, Regis Philbin also passed away this year. He was born on August 25, 1931, and lived to July 24, 2020 (88). He passed away from a heart attack in his home. He had heart disease and had suffered many issues in the past. He is well known for being a tv show present, talk show host, and game show host. He was once called “the hardest working man in show business”. He has won 4 Emmy awards and had a star in the Hollywood walk of fame, along with getting a key to the city from Michael Bloomberg in 2011 for his significant contribution to New York media. He also holds the Guinness World record for most hours on U.S. television, with over 16,700 hours. He has been successful on television for many decades, and active from 1955-2020. His long time friend and co-host Kathie Lee Gifford tweeted “REGIS. There will never be another.” <br>&emsp;&emsp;Finally, Eddie Van Halen also perished in 2020. He was born on January 26, 1955, and lived to October 6, 2020 (65). He passed away from cancer. He spent 5 decades as the lead guitarist of the rock band, Van halen. He made numerous innovations in how guitars could be played, as well as how they could be built and how they could sound. His death was announced by his son on Twitter, saying “He was the best father I could have ever asked for. Every moment I’ve shared with him on and off stage was a gift.” <br>"

Some smile, but most glare. Some just barely recognize you, while others give an apathetic glance. Or, if you are really unlucky, you get a grimace full of hatred and you look down, full of dismay. This year wasn’t going to be as hoped, it appears. With kids that don’t even know you patronizing you with a shout of “freshman”, in a seemingly sarcastic manner. They turn a typical word into one that has an incredibly derogatory connotation and it melts your hope in a second. It shows that they meant to chastise you rather than sending you off with a grand “Welcome To CHS!” Don’t they remember the nerves that they had only a couple of years ago? Weren’t they just the ones wishing for some friendly peer to help them as they got lost and to make them feel welcomed and as they belong and that it is okay? Well, that is only before guide room even begins. Add the new building and new schedules into the mix and the problem is amplified to a new unforeseen magnitude. Some kids adjust well, just glancing at their schedule, while others trip on the stairs and bump into people until they get to the refuge of a new class with a teacher that you don’t even know because they can’t risk taking their eyes off the sheet of paper. But you are grateful to realize that the teacher is kind and willing to help you. Maybe you surprise yourself by finding your safe place in a science class, or whatever class is far from your favorite. But whatever helps relieve some amount of stress. For the lucky kids with lunch, you get a nice break. Except for the anxiety of walking into a large room full of more people that you do not know. You stand awkwardly and slowly walk in looking for a friendly face. Finally, you meet eyes with someone that you would consider a friend, at least under these circumstances. Or maybe your best friend is also there. Time flies by, and it is time for your final classes, and soon enough you are going to the bus. And then you sit in the first empty seat you see and plug in your headphones until you stop at your house and you walk in with a pile of homework for both you and your parents because, after all, you are in high school now. And despite what you felt earlier that day, high school might not be that bad. Much more time now for your afternoon nap!"

        "text": "&emsp;&emsp;Media Mogul and multi platinum pop star by day and constructing the “new world order” by night is Beyoncé’s life goal. According to a prominent pop culture conspiracy that has been circling one of music's biggest trailblazers for years, Beyoncé is a big part of the Illuminati, or a secret society that originated in the 1700’s whose goals were to influence all aspects of life, including religious and even superstition based beliefs. The conspiracy that Beyoncé is an active member of the famed secret society, the “Illuminati” is based on many factors including her use of famed Illuminati hand signals and the “hidden meanings” behind her performances and photos that arise virtually every time she makes a move.  <br>&emsp;&emsp;It should be noted that the Illuminati is well known as a viciously exclusive secret society that is trying to create a new world order. They want nothing more than to establish an “authoritarian gang of elites that control the entire world's major dealings”, said Martha Gill from The Guardian. There is no proof that the Illuminati operates today, but conspiracy theorists think otherwise.  Naturally, the glitz, glamour and influence of today's music industry is a considerable target for the Illuminati. Beyoncé, a music figurehead, has become a target too, mostly because of some of the ways and styles she has performed live. People take issue with some of her hand signals and clothing choices. Specifically in her distinguished 2018 Coachella performance, people believe the use of hand signals that Beyoncé used connects her to the Illuminati. These include gestures like Beyoncé making a circle over her eye and making triangle hands. These gestures are commonly known as Illuminati symbolism and Beyoncé has used them multiple times before, including in her Super Bowl halftime performance.  These are completely baseless connections because of the fact that Beyoncé's husband, rapper Jay- Z, has a record label called Roc Nation which has a famous triangle logo. In fact, Jay-Z has been seen many times flashing the symbol. The most compelling piece of evidence comes when you listen to the portion of the song that is being sung as Beyoncé makes the gesture. The lyrics are “The rock I'm rockin', I've bought it.” This is a play on words which cross references the record label's name to the rock, which is slang for diamond, according to Timothy Rapp from Bleacher Report.  Her triangle hand symbol is easily connected to her husband's business dealings and not the secret society.  <br>&emsp;&emsp;Beyoncé is well known for her ultra unique style and design visions that carry over from her live performance sets and music videos, to her fashion and even Instagram posts. Specifically, Beyoncé's pregnancy announcement Instagram photo allegedly contains Iluminati references. Beyoncé's photo shows the obviously pregnant singer wearing a flowing veil surrounded by flowers. It just so happens that her body makes the shape of a triangle, or the Illuminati trademark shape. According to James Ballardie from BBC News, “Theories say the presence of a pyramid or triangle represents the top down command structure of the world.” This is a huge reach and easily disprovable based on the fact that there is no evidence supporting the conspiracy whatsoever. In fact, the position she is photographed in is not eyebrow raising at all. She is simply kneeling which many people have done, and will do frequently throughout their lives without question or a second thought. It's absurd that this is a “core piece of evidence” when it realistically doesn't even point in the direction of reasonable suspicion. Beyoncé also draws the same suspicion from conspiracy theorists in her “Single Ladies” music video. The conspiracy states that, some claim that messages can be heard when the song is played in reverse that connect her to the Illuminati. This is not confirmed by Beyoncé herself or any of her associates. Also, why would Beyoncé want to risk her cover being blown seeing as the Illuminati is vigorously secretive? However, Beyoncé completely shut down rumors of her involvement with the secret society. In her song “Formation”, the lyrics state, “Y’all haters corny with that Illuminati mess”. Beyoncé is literally saying that she's not in the Illuminati because she's calling allegers ‘haters.” However conspiracy theorists believe that when the hook of the song kicks in, fans quickly forget about the Illuminati reference and she can legitimately say she addressed the theory while drawing attention away from her alleged involvement. It is unclear how the songstress could possibly disassociate herself from the secret society more than opening her lead single with a line clearly denying her ties, but conspiracy theorists will persist.  <br>&emsp;&emsp;The fact of the matter is that no one even distantly connected to Beyoncé or her camp has even entertained these rumors. Most of the “evidence” is completely debunked. The most compelling puncture in the balloon of Beyoncé's Illuminati connection is that Beyoncé herself declined the rumors in the first line of her hit song “Formation.” The evidence is not compelling in most cases of this topic, but it does stem from something, even though some of it is not corroborated. For instance, why is the Roc Nation logo a triangle in the first place? Why is Beyonce associating herself with the triangle symbol in seemingly every performance? Considering the secretive ways of the group behind the construction of the new world order, these questions, and more, such as the real nature of Beyoncé's Illuminati connections, will likely never be answered."

        "text": "&emsp;&emsp;Though BTS, a popular K-pop group, has been flooding the media with their recent records, their rise to success was not easy.<br>&emsp;&emsp;BTS debuted in 2013 under the company Big Hit Entertainment- now Big Hit Labels- with their song “No More Dream”. At the time, Big Hit was on the verge of bankruptcy barely able to support their artists. BTS had a tough time because of how small their company was, but, either way, they were still able to debut. However,  it was not as successful as they hoped it to be. “No More Dream” did not become a hit and, sadly, neither would their following releases “N.O,” “Boy in Luv,” or “Danger”. <br>&emsp;&emsp;It wasn’t until 2015 with their song “I Need U” did BTS start to gain popularity in South Korea. After this, BTS’ career took off with all their new songs rapidly rising on the charts. They were producing hit after hit and astonishing audiences with their synchronised performances and upbeat songs. <br>&emsp;&emsp;After gaining so much popularity in South Korea from 2015 to 2016, their international fame also started to grow. In 2017 with the release of their new album “Love Yourself: Her” and title track “DNA,” they debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 for the first time at number 83 and topped all the Korean charts. They also reached number 1 on the Billboard Top Social 50 Chart for the first time (and have currently stayed there for 202 weeks). They were even invited to the American Music Awards to perform.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Their popularity has continued to grow worldwide and, to this day,  has not stopped. Lately, their new single “Dynamite” has broken multiple records like “Most Viewed Music Video in 24 Hours,” “Most Viewed Youtube Video in 24 Hours,” and “Most Viewed Youtube Video in 24 Hours by a K-pop group” with 101.1 million views. They also have the title for “Most Commented On YouTube Video” with 6.5 million comments. And most recently, BTS are the first Korean act to reach the top of the Billboard Hot 100 Chart.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The list of their records could go on and on, but BTS are still incredibly humble. Though they have reached immeasurable success, they remain the 7 boys who were from a small company in South Korea hoping to share their positive message through music."

        "tags": "industry clothing clothes",
        "text": "&emsp;&emsp;What is fast fashion? It’s probably what you’re wearing right now. At some point, you’ve most likely been asked to look at your shirt or pants tag to see where they were manufactured. In this exercise, the point being made is that our clothes are more often than not made somewhere very far away.<br>&emsp;&emsp;But really, what is fast fashion? Why is it made far away? The dictionary will tell you that fast fashion is “inexpensive clothing produced rapidly by mass-market retailers in response to the latest trends”. Fast fashion is the reason we can find dresses at Forever 21 for under thirty dollars. Isn’t that good though? Who wants to spend one hundred dollars for just one pair of jeans, or one shirt? Well, the prices are so affordable because not much money at all goes into production. The fabric is cheap, which means the clothes won’t last a long time, and so is labor. Fast Fashion brands use manufacturers in places like China, India, and Bangladesh where there aren’t as many restrictions and regulations to protect workers. Therefore, brands can get away with paying their workers very little money. This way, Brands can charge less while still making a profit. <br>&emsp;&emsp;So, where does “produced rapidly” come in? You may notice that trends change quickly these days, so fast even that it’s hard to keep up without buying new clothes frequently. These brands like Forever 21, Shein, Zara, and Fashion Nova are producing style after style to keep up with changing trends so either a garment falls apart because it’s so cheap, or we simply don’t wear it anymore because it’s no longer trendy. Because of the fast-paced output and short life of fast fashion garments, textile wastes are ruining our environment. We are throwing away clothes almost as fast as we buy them.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The fast fashion industry exploits underprivileged workers all over the world and is damaging our environment at the same time. It would be nice if the easy solution was to just stop buying fast fashion and while that would be environmentally sustainable, for many people it is not economically sustainable. Think about why brands like Gucci and Alexander McQueen are so expensive. When you add the cost of well-made clothes and the cost of livable wages for the workers, you get five thousand dollar dresses and five hundred dollar sneakers. That example was an extreme, but ethical brands that make clothes to last a long time and that pay livable wages are still expensive. What do we do? Buying fast fashion really can be inevitable and we shouldn’t feel responsible for what huge brands are doing to our environment and their workers. What we can do, is be more conscious about where we spend our money. Try not to go clothes shopping when you don’t need to, and when you do want more clothes give secondhand clothes a try. We can thrift (but stay away from winter coats and other necessities that other people may not be able to afford elsewhere) and we can upcycle what we already have. Even if you don’t want to go digging through a thrift store there are apps like Depop, ThreadUp, and Poshmark where you can filter for what you want. These apps are also useful for getting rid of clothes you don’t wear anymore. You can make money off of all three, but ThreadUp is especially useful because all you have to do is mail in your clothes and they take care of the rest. Even if clothes don’t sell, ThreadUp makes sure that the leftover pieces are properly recycled. Fast fashion is still a growing industry and it can be unavoidable at times but we should still be doing our best to make better choices when it comes to what we wear."

        "text": "&emsp;&emsp;Everyone looks forward to the Halloween season. Trick or treating with friends, carving pumpkins with loved ones, and trading candy. This year the spooky season looked a bit different. The global pandemic has affected everyone and the beloved October 31st. However, people are getting creative with their new ways of celebrating. <br>&emsp;&emsp;The East Greenbush Central School District rents costumes for their spring musical from the Costumer located in Albany. The Costumer sells Halloween costumes and face masks. I spoke with the Sales Manager, Elizabeth K, about how Halloween is looking different for the business this year. She stated that, “If someone picks out a costume that doesn’t have the mask they're trying to find matching face masks to go with it.” Elizabeth also stated that, “Group costumes are always really popular but we’re seeing more and more of it so we actually have mommy and me, daddy and me, and full family options this year.” While trick or treating may sound like a classic tradition Elizabeth said customers are also finding other ways to get in the spirit like costume parades and trunk or treating by cars.<br>&emsp;&emsp;When October approaches, pumpkins make their way to the front steps of houses. At Ellms Family Farm in Ballston Spa, a family friendly Pumpkin Glow and Light Show, allowed families to see some incredibly designed pumpkins. At Ellms, families drove through the farm with the view of many designs such as sugar skulls, dinosaurs, bumble bees, and werewolves. Families were also invited to purchase apple cider, donuts, and kettle corn. <br>&emsp;&emsp;Many families in the East Greenbush area look forward to the town’s Community and Recreation Department’s trunk or treating each year. This year was no different. Families had the opportunity to sign up for any of the four time slots to play games and receive candy and prizes. All four of the events filled up and masks were required to participate.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Field of Horrors located in Troy, is notorious for having elaborate scares. They had five attractions this year and brought the fright from a safe distance. Face coverings were required along with reduced capacity and social distancing between parties. <br>&emsp;&emsp;Double M Haunted Hayrides in Ballston Spa offered a Dead End Drive Thru Experience this year. Those who chose the spooky experience stayed in their vehicle at all times. Customers were also offered the opportunity to order cider and donuts online. This experience was offered as a safe alternative for customers. <br>&emsp;&emsp;The Jericho Drive-In located in Glenmont showed some spooky classics this season. Even though indoor movie theatres were not open until recently, the outdoor drive-in was allowed to offer customers a chance to view some of their favorites. A few of the movies included Halloween, A Nightmare on Elm Street, and Beetlejuice. <br>&emsp;&emsp;While the Halloween season may have been different this year one thing is for sure no matter the circumstances, the East Greenbush area really knows how to bring the fun for Halloween."

        "text": "&emsp;&emsp;The Coronavirus (or COVID-19 as the cool kids call it) has recently taken the world by storm. The disease, although not entirely fatal, has spread exponentially across the work, creating a pandemic situation which hasn't been experienced in decades. The cases have escalated from 4,000 in central China, to 100,000 globally. Of those 100,000 however,  about 40,000 have recovered. The mortality rate for the infection is still relatively high for a disease of this sort nearly 3.5%. But why is the Coronavirus so dangerous, and why have people been unable to stop it?  <br>&emsp;&emsp;In order to answer the question, one first needs to understand what the Coronavirus is. The Virus itself is a distant relative of the SARS virus from 2002, which had a similar outbreak. However, SARS was significantly less concerning than COVID-19 because it was not as easily spread to other people (only about 8,000), and did not cause as many deaths. The biology of COVID-19 is what makes it more dangerous than its predecessors. COVID-19 is an RNA virus. Like all viruses, it invades a cell and uses it's machinery to replicate and spread to other cells. RNA is made into protein in the cell through ribosomes. The virus inserts its RNA into the cell, and then uses the cell's ribosomes to create more of itself. However, this virus is especially unique because it is able to use the host cell to create an enzyme called RNA dependent RNA polymerase. This enzyme is the first thing that the virus makes in the cell, and the enzyme itself essentially duplicates the RNA of the virus at an exponential rate, causing many Viral RNAs to come from one virus. This is in part what accounts for COVID-19's ability to be spread so easily. With all the viral RNAs now present in the cell, the virus can make tens of thousands of itself from one cell. And spread at an extremely fast rate.  <br>&emsp;&emsp;Another danger of the virus however is it's extremely long incubation period (the time when one is infected but doesn't show symptoms). This could be due in part to the long life cycle of the virus, or the fact that the body cannot detect the virus because it evades the immune system. Although no one knows for sure, the virus's ability to replicate in large amounts in a relatively short time accounts for its dangerous behaviors. One unfortunate aspect of the virus, however, is it's extremely high rate of mutation. Because the virus changes so frequently, and this particular again has never been seen before,  scientist have had difficulties researching COVID-19.  <br>&emsp;&emsp;With the virus spreading throughout the Country, and even within the state, everyone should take proper sanitary precautions in the coming months to stay healthy, and safe from the dangerous infection. It's important that everyone is careful and cautious, as the virus can easily be spread unknowingly from person to person."

        "text": "&emsp;&emsp;When I say funny, I most certainly do not mean how awkward that title sounded.  I also don’t mean a teacher’s face when they realize I’ve written the word “I” twice in only the first sentence.  I mean actual hilarity.  Legitimate laughing, not a groan, or a snicker, or one of those sneezes dogs have attempted (and possibly some humans too).  Let’s face it, writing humorously without injuring your arm bones is quite difficult.  Teaching people how to write in this style is even more difficult, but I will go over a few key points in the following insufferable paragraphs.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Laughter can easily be gained from insulting and annoying others, but I don’t want to be kicked out of writing useless articles in the newspaper that very few people actually read, so I’ll go with something more kind than that.  (Though this method is still debatable.  As the saying goes, all argumentative topics are interesting.  Actually, I might have just made that up to continue a conversation about weighing a pound of bricks against a pound of an unnamed individual’s brain mass.  Or simply to continue an obnoxious conversation in parentheses that forces the reader to forget the main idea of the article so they have to read the entire thing again).  Insulting yourself is much more of a useful way to bring laughs.  It allows everybody else to laugh and it also allows yourself to laugh because you still have blackmail materials for them.  (That’s right, don’t mess with me.  Maybe it was you who was in the conversation of brain mass to bricks).  For the most stubborn people, ignore this method completely, reveal the blackmail materials, and force them to counterfeit laughter in front of a crowd.<br>&emsp;&emsp;A third way to make people laugh is to make them think too hard.  Like how this is really the second way.  Unless it is the hour way of course.  Or the way that you read the frist sentence incorrectly.  Except the first sentence in this paragraph was perfectly normal and it was really the sentence just previously was that the real mistake.   Except that sentence also had a mistake in it.  And now you are checking every sentence for mistakes, where you will find none except that the word except is overused and that a few of these sentences are fragments.  While you may not have laughed at that confusing amalgamation, everybody else is laughing at you because you are annoyed.  At least somebody is laughing.<br>&emsp;&emsp;The real third way (as the previous way was truly the second) of creating hilarity is to...<br>&emsp;&emsp;The fourth and final idea for getting some laughs must be done in a group.  Simply repeat some choice words over and over again until they become unpronounceable.  Words like chin, shoelace, and smock work quite well.  In fact, you can make a game out of it.  Pick an absurd word and ask somebody else questions.  They must answer every question with that word.  If they laugh at all, they lose.<br>&emsp;&emsp;...have a delayed punchline."

        "text": "&emsp;&emsp;If art wasn’t subjective, this world would explode. In fact, this world is on the verge of exploding because many people don’t view art as subjective in this day and age. One of the most polarizing people to argue for this right is Lana Del Rey. She rose to popularity after her 2012 album, “Born To Die,” and is known for her soft, silky tone paired with serious and gruesome lyrics about domestic violence, drug use and more negatives. Apparently, that’s a big problem for some music critics. Recently, Del Rey has been under fire for allegedly “glamorizing violence” throughout her discography. <br>&emsp;&emsp;I pose this question in response, if Lana Del Rey is glamorizing violence in her music, is Ariana Grande not glamorizing shopping addiction and in her own?  Is Taylor Swift not glamorizing serial dating? Is Drake not glamorizing hoarding money? Is Kanye West not glamorizing bi-polar depression and mania? No one has made these claims before. My theory is because of the difference in depth of Del Rey’s lyrics versus the other listed players, and most other mainstream artists. <br>&emsp;&emsp;A song like “7 Rings,” by Ariana Grande, is much less substantive at face value than a Lana song. A direct quote from “7 Rings” is “I want it, I got it, I want it I got it, I want it, I got it.” There is not much negative that can be concluded from such a line, most would even call it “empowering” because it's basically saying you can get any material item you want, you're rich. But contextually, in reference with the entire album this song is found on, that line is detailing an unhealthy coping mechanism in the form of a shopping addiction. It takes a quick Google search into Grande’s background during the time of the album’s release to realize she had a lot of negatives in her life. Referenced to the other tracks on this album, it's obvious to see this song is not meant to be a female empowerment anthem in Grande’s mind.  However, it’s widely regarded as empowering and fun. And that's the whole point. Who's to say that I can't look at a line like “I want it, I got it” and think, “wow, I'm going to strive to get that promotion so I can buy whatever I want,” when it’s contextually clear that Ariana didn't write the song with the intent of sending that message. <br>&emsp;&emsp;If we start gatekeeping the morals and takeaways of music, society will basically divulge into a grey, drab, desert with a few basic trap songs about dating, cheating, being rich and being famous.  So if Lana Del Rey is glorifying violence, then ALL music is glorifying a negative mechanism of some sort. If you're going to be mad at Lana, you'd better be ready to come after just about every artist besides Kidz Bop, I guess."

Those songs also happen to be the same ones that people play months before Christmas, which I have a problem with. I can handle watching all of the movies repeatedly and seeing all of the decorations, in fact I like looking at the decorations, but Christmas songs before Thanksgiving is where I draw the line on my holiday spirit. Of course I know people in my own family that would listen to these songs all year round and would strongly argue with me about my opinions. I can’t even hide from these songs in my own house, but I will not let myself enjoy them until after Thanksgiving. Some people may call me a “Scrooge” or a “Grinch”, but I have never said “Bah Humbug”or “I hate Christmas”.

        "text": "&emsp;&emsp;Mario Kart Tour, aka Mario Kart for our phones, has recently taken the school, and the larger world, by storm. Most kids' infatuation with the Mario Series over the last many years, and the addition of the game being widely accessible and free to play, has ensured its number one spot on the app charts and in everyone's attention. Most people have enjoyed the game and found it easy to win. However with the prospect of Nintendo consistently adding game-changing updates, the hype around the app will rise and fall but the skill level of the other players will only improve. These are some tips I've found useful for winning races since the games initial launch in September 2019.  <br>&emsp;&emsp;First, choose the character, kart and glider which give you the most amount of points. At first I was picking the characters I liked the most and not the ones which would give me the most points in that race so I had to keep replaying races to get 5 stars. Next, you should turn on manual drift, turn off smart steering, and turn on gyro handling. Doing this will not only make it easier for you to drift, but drifting helps you acquire the maximum points to achieve 5 stars on that race.  <br>&emsp;&emsp;One of the most advantageous things you can do is hold onto your items when you get them from an item box. People have a tendency to immediately throw or use what they got. However, depending on what item you have, it could potentially save you from losing the race if you keep it on you. If the person behind you throws a shell at you and you have a shell, banana or bomb on you, not being used, the opponent's shell will destroy your item and will not hurt you at all. This helps when you're about to hit the finish line and you get sniped. You won't be hurt anymore if you just save your item for as long as you possibly can.  <br>&emsp;&emsp;The next thing is something everyone uses. but it's very important to hold down the screen once the number 2, on the countdown comes up. Not 3, or 1... but 2. This will give you a rocket start, and if you don't use that it's going to be much harder to get into 1st.  <br>&emsp;&emsp;Finally my favorite trick. Slipstreaming. This has won me many races. To slipstream, you have to ride directly behind the person in front of you for a few seconds and suddenly, you will get a speed boost and get way out in front of them.This is a great strategy if you're in 2nd and the finish line is coming up.  <br>&emsp;&emsp;You might already use a lot of these tricks, but you should definitely keep using them, because the random japanese players that are exponentially faster than everyone, are getting better as the days go on. That along with the anticipated addition of multiplayer which will be harder for most as well. The secret to winning a Mario Kart Tour race lies in the strategy. "

        "text": "&emsp;&emsp;After spending some time watching modern movies, for a change, I decided to watch a movie that many consider a classic. Forrest Gump is a film that tells the story of its titular character as he lives through different time periods and events, such as the Vietnam War. Despite its dramatization of historical events and somewhat messy plot, Forrest Gump is a film that is both entertaining and heartfelt. The movie shows how Gump maintains his positive outlook and ideals about life even through difficult situations. The movie at first glance may seem like a very disjointed series of events. At one moment, Gump is fighting in a war, then the next, he's playing Ping Pong against China. But, this seemingly disjointed feel is what helps accentuate its most crucial themes of maintaining ideals. The love story between Gump, and his childhood friend, Jenny, is what serves as the connective tissue throughout all of Forrest's different experiences. Although their relationship seems naïve at first, it becomes increasingly clear why they are unable to be together; while Forrest keeps the same outlook and ideas, Jenny changes with the times. Because Gump is such a likable character, sometimes Jenny can come off as annoying. In fact, one flaw the movie has is sacrificing the characterization of supporting roles in order to keep the attention focused on Forrest. Many characters, like Lieutenant Dan and Bubba lack scenes where they are given complete focus. Much of their development happens in the presence of Forrest, which in some ways dampens the effect of their character journeys by portraying them as reliant on Forrest's help. Moreover, the progression of many characters occurs offscreen. This makes some scenes, such as the reunion between Jenny and Gump shocking, but at the same time confusing, because characters change so much. Nevertheless, the movie overcomes its flaws through its comedic timing and style. Forrest is shown to be a bit of an oddball to others. Such interactions help create tension during scenes. It also allows for the creation of funny, and lighthearted scenes that make the film fun and entertaining. Even when covering stories like the Vietnam war, Gump's personality and relatability allow for effective uses of humor. This makes emotional scenes more effective as well since they stand out. The movie is definitely carried by the performance of Tom Hanks. It's easy to forget that Hanks is acting in a movie when he delivers charisma and heart to every scene he's in. The score also fits well with the movie, in the sense that it tries to use songs from the time periods of the different settings. This allows the audience to become even more immersed in the world created by the movie. All in all, Forrest Gump remains a classic film because of its timeless themes, and unique artistic qualities. <br>My score for the movie is an 8.2/10"

        "text": "&emsp;&emsp;Back in February, Parasite received extensive coverage by the media because of its controversial nature. On one hand, many people praised the film for its engaging storytelling and modern themes. On the other hand, many people, including the president, criticized the movie because it was a foreign film that people couldn't comprehend. After watching the movie twice, I can say for sure that the praise was well warranted. The movie centers around the life of a poverty-stricken family, and how they try to ameliorate their situation by conning a rich family. The movie starts off quite normally. It develops its core set of characters though elaborate interactions and actions for the first half of the film. Although this causes the film to drag in the first half, it doesn't affect the viewing experience much. Each scene builds upon the tension and elevates the stakes of the story. Because of this, the film's twist works perfectly. It occurs almost exactly in the middle of the film, and it transforms the movie from a drama about class struggles, to a thriller about survival. Because of the relationships and stakes established by the first half of the film, all of the family's misfortunes are made to be emotional blows to the audience as well.  One flaw which stood out to me, however, was how some situations escalated from avoidable circumstances since it took me out of the movie at times. The movie makes up for this and other minor flaws, however, though it's complex and thematic storytelling. An example of this could be seen in the name of the movie itself. While many viewers may brand the poor Kim family as parasitic for tricking the rich Park family and using their wealth and resources, the same logic could be applied to the Parks and the housekeepers family. The parks could especially be seen as parasitic because of how they thrive off the work of the lower class. The movie in many ways criticizes the capitalist system because of its destructive nature, and how it provides a sense of false hope for the lower class. Because of how the film relates to the common struggles of society, the film is able to connect with its audience on a personal level. Because of this, Parasite may very well go on to become a modern classic. <br>My score for the movie is a 9.5/10"

        "text": "&emsp;&emsp;On November 3rd, America will choose between the Republican incumbent, Donald Trump, and the democratic challenger Joe Biden. Biden is ahead in national polls and has recently surged above Trump in terms of campaign contributions from supporters. However, Trump continues to hold rallies in various swing states to grow his voter base. No matter what the outcome is, early voting and the encouragement of mail-in voting has expanded potential for all voters to cast their ballots. In 2020, an extraordinary amount of political debate came from issues like health care, gun control, the climate crisis and especially COVID-19 relief. <br>&emsp;&emsp;So what is Trump’s plan? If the Republican incumbent wins a second term, he has said he will likely approve a relief bill in congress that would give federal aid to qualifying U.S. citizens. Trump has already made some polarizing and provocative remarks regarding COVID, and his actions have spoken even louder. Trump has a history of not wearing masks and he believes that a federal mask mandate is not “necessary.” Controversially, Trump also wanted to slow down CoronaVirus testing in order to save face for the U.S. On the topic of healthcare, an important entity in these times, Donald Trump wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA or ObamaCare), which supplies over 20 million Americans with healthcare. He has not shared his plan for a replacement to Obamacare at this time. <br>&emsp;&emsp;Additionally, Trump’s stance on gun violence includes expanding background checks and keeping mentally ill people from legally accessing firearms. Trump also banned a gun attachment called a “bump stock” which makes a semi-automatic weapon fire continuously. On the topic of climate change, Trump’s own EPA chief believes that global warming is not a major concern of the country. Most notably, the president withdrew the U.S. from The Paris Climate Accord which is a multinational deal that aims to curb climate change. Major world players like France, Canada, China and over 100 more countries are part of the agreement. <br>&emsp;&emsp;On the other hand, Joe Biden and the democrats have significantly different plans for the country. Biden’s COVID-19 response aims to increase testing as much as possible. Drive through testing would become much easier and more abundant under a Biden administration. It would also be completely free for all Americans. For the economic pitfalls of CoronaVirus, Biden wants to retain and rehire workers as well as provide monumental relief for small businesses who have been hit extremely hard in the wake of the pandemic. On the issue of healthcare, Biden’s plan would expand on Obamacare and make it cheaper in general. There would also be a public option which is reminiscent of a medicare for all plan, only not everyone would have to use it. A common misconception about the Biden campaign is that he will not allow citizens to maintain their private insurance plans, but that is completely false. <br>&emsp;&emsp;Additionally, Joe Biden’s gun control plan would incorporate a method that he calls “smart guns.” This new practice would require weapon manufacturers to “include biometric measures that would block firearms from being used by those whose fingerprints aren’t registered for that specific gun.” Controversially, Biden also wants to start a federal gun buyback program which would financially incentivize citizens to give up their guns. <br>&emsp;&emsp;Biden takes a much more aggressive response to climate change than his competitor. If elected, he will introduce a $1.7 trillion dollar method for the U.S. to end greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Biden is not interested in banning fracking on a national level, but has expressed interest in banning fracking on federally owned land. He would also rejoin the Paris Climate Accord to impede the negative effects of global warming and climate change. <br>&emsp;&emsp;Both candidates have sharply opposite views and have used that fact to win support of the voters. As a result of the current state of the country, this could be the most important general election yet and voter turnout is expected to be much higher than in 2016. The impact of COVID and healthcare spans across millions of citizens who now know that if they don't use their voice, their general way of life will change without their say."

        "text": "&emsp;&emsp;This school year is one unlike any other. Teachers and students both take on a new challenge of remote learning: but which side has the advantage?  Let’s hear both sides of the story with two students at Columbia High School on opposite ends of the spectrum. A Full Remote Student vs. a Hybrid Student. <br><br>1.) Are you enjoying Remote Learning?   What are some advantages of Remote Learning?<br>&emsp;&emsp;“For the most part, I do enjoy remote learning. I like the fact that I’m able to stay completely safe and get the same education as the people going into school. I have enough time to complete my schoolwork AND any extra work that I have outside of school because I don’t have to sit on long bus rides to and from school anymore. I  love that I’m able to sit in my pj’s all day and eat my french toast!”<br><br>1.) Are you enjoying Hybrid Learning? What are some advantages of Hybrid Learning?<br>&emsp;&emsp;“I guess I’m enjoying Hybrid Learning; it's definitely different. I have a lot more freetime and I’d say it’s the ‘best of both worlds’ because I get to go to school and also work from home. I get to see my teachers in-person and some of my friends but I wouldn’t say that I have that much of an advantage; I barely get to speak with most of them unless they are in my classes. But there is a little bit of normalcy to my schedule.  For remote days, I enjoy the fact that I can do my work and have my breakfast and coffee in the comfort of my own home!”<br><br>2.) On a scale of 1-10, as a full remote student, how well would you say you are handling your schoolwork? Is it easier or harder?<br>&emsp;&emsp;“I would say about a 9 because I can get my work done as fast as I can. I usually finish up my work during  my free periods and when I’m done with school. But this is all after a quick snack break of course.”<br><br>2.) On a scale of 1-10, as a hybrid learner,  how well would you say you are handling your schoolwork? Is it easier or harder?<br>&emsp;&emsp;“I’d say surprisingly around a 7. In the beginning it was a lot harder because I had to teach myself some things. Adjusting was hard but now it’s become a lot easier. Since we have had a lot of assignments over google classroom in the past I am used to using this platform, but now there is an added practice of teaching myself a few topics.”<br><br>3.) Do you think your teachers are doing a good job engaging full remote students?<br>&emsp;&emsp;“Sometimes teachers aren’t able to answer my question right away so it’s harder to communicate and actively participate in class. Since school has started, teachers have been able to tweak their teaching style to include remote students. As of now, I think most teachers have been doing a great job involving the remote students.”<br><br>3.) Do you think teachers are spending too much time trying to involve the full remote students?<br>&emsp;&emsp;“No, I don't think they have been spending too much time trying to involve the remote students. In the beginning of the year there were a few technical difficulties that needed to be worked out, but I think they're doing a really good job adjusting to everybody's schedules. I haven't really noticed any differences in the amount of involvement.”<br><br>4.) What is one thing you wish you could change about your situation as a remote learner?<br>&emsp;&emsp;“I wish that my materials were more accessible. I have had to go into school to pick up my materials multiple times which is a bit of a hassle. For example, materials such as textbooks and other items have to be picked up from school, and if I forget something I need to go back and get it. But I have definitely improved my time management skills as a full remote learner and I mostly feel like I am not missing out on any new topics my teachers discuss in class.” <br><br>4.) What is one thing you wish you could change about your situation as a hybrid learner?<br>&emsp;&emsp;“Honestly, I wish more people were able to go into school (although it's currently impossible) because I miss seeing the faces I used to see everyday. But I also like hybrid a lot; it's a very good balance of school and work. Overall I feel like hybrid works better with my schedule. You just need to be motivated enough to make it work and adjust to online learning and in person learning.” <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;Taking a closer look into the life of a full remote student vs. a hybrid student has revealed that both sides have their own pros and cons; but in the end, there is no clear winner. The district has handled the situation extremely well, giving students the option to stay at home or come into school for their own safety. The staff and students are trying their very best to maintain “normalcy” during these unprecedented times."

        "text": "&emsp;&emsp;The secret garden was a phenomenal play put on by Columbia high school. I was able to see it last Saturday, and it was my first time seeing a Columbia production of this sort. Despite some of its negative aspects, the play shines through with its colorful music and amazing acting. What the play may lack in coherence, it makes up for in presentation.  <br>&emsp;&emsp;Firstly, there were many positives to the play. One aspect which I liked the best was the singing and music performed by the pit orchestra. Although there were a few mistakes every now and then, and some of the pitches were out of tune, the music sounded like it was straight out of a professional production. The performances by Benson Haley, Meaghan Almon, and Eli Wein were especially great in my opinion. In fact, Eli showed an incredible performance during the play, everything from his acting to his mannerisms were able to effectively convey the emotions of his character. In addition to Eli, the stage crew did a great job with set changes and effects during the play. The quick changes from the garden setting to Archibald's study were amazing to watch, as the crew displayed amazing precision through the entirety of the play. Lastly, the performance by Brianna Bujak was amazing to watch, as her poignant acting and singing provided an energetic presence on stage.  <br>&emsp;&emsp;Despite these positive aspects to the play however, there were a few parts that I didn't like as much. The first aspect of the play that I found the most confusing was the story progression in the first half of the play. Although it was wonderfully acted and sung, it was difficult to understand what was going on in the past and present. This, along with some of the plot points being delivered entirely through song, made the first half of the play a bit difficult to follow. However, the second half made up for it by having a more coherent structure and delivery. Moreover, the accents used in the play were a bit inconsistent.  Additionally, some of the Hindi pronunciations were incorrectly pronounced and made some of the dialog a bit rough. But this is pretty understandable, considering it's a difficult foreign language to speak.  <br>&emsp;&emsp;All in all, I felt like the play was a wonderful culmination of Colbumia's musical and theatrical talents. Despite a few negative aspects, I can easily say that this has been one of the best plays put on by Columbia."

        "text": "&emsp;&emsp;Practicing healthy self care routines are essential especially with the circumstances we are experiencing now. Taking care of ourselves encourages us to maintain healthy relationships with ourselves so we can be the best version of ourselves. When you have a good mindset you are also able to transmit more energy towards your dreams, friends/family etc... Exercising quality self care routines are clinically proven to reduce stress, anxiety and depression. Below are 5 simple self care suggestions that I have found really helpful! <br><br><b>8+ hours of sleep-</b> I know a lot of us struggle with fulfilling decent hours of sleep. Consistent sleep schedules are so important and have many benefits when it comes to your overall mood. One tip for good sleep is staying off of electronics an hour before bedtime.<br><br><b>Exercise-</b> I am not a morning person and will never be. Exercising gives me something to look forward to in the morning and helps wake me up. The days that I choose to exercise tend to be my most productive days. If you’re just starting out with a routine make sure to, avoid making excuses to stay consistent. <br><br><b>Journaling-</b> This is a great way to keep track of your mood. You can simply start off by writing your goals for the day. This has helped me express all of my feelings effectively. Journaling makes me feel less stressed and ready to tackle the day.<br><br><b>Social interaction-</b> Make an effort to reach out frequently with friends and engage those who tend to isolate. Talking to each other will relieve stress and promote a positive outlook. <br><br><b>Reduce screen time-</b> We all struggle with screen time because it’s tempting to check your phone every 5 minutes. You can create a screen time limit in your phone settings. It is important to stay present and connected with the real world rather than the lives portrayed on the endless tunnel of social media. <br><br><i>I hope these simple but effective tips were helpful! Remember, we all need time for ourselves.</i>"

        "text": "&emsp;&emsp;Two of the most modern prominent music streaming services are Apple Music and Spotify. Ever since Apple Music was created in 2015, nine years after Spotify, there has been a huge debate over which is the superior. Even though Apple Music claims to have 50 million playable songs while Spotify claims 35 million,Spotify is still the best of the two by a landslide. I personally have been using Spotify, daily, since early 2016, however, I did use Apple Music for 3 months on their free trial and I was able to observe some of their many shortcomings compared to Spotify.  <br>&emsp;&emsp;First of all, Spotify has a free tier with ads which accommodates everyone even without having to pay for a monthly subscription. Apple Music only allows non subscribers to listen to their “Beats 1 Radio” channel which is basically nothing compared to the free range of Spotify non subscription.  <br>&emsp;&emsp;Spotify has always been aesthetically better. From the beginning , Spotify has been in the more desirable dark mode while Apple Music only just gave its subscribers the option of dark mode along with IOS 13 this past September. Spotify is a simpler interface in my opinion, there are three tabs at the bottom of the app which are “Home”, “Search” and “Your Library”. This makes the navigation of the app easier and faster. Apple Music has 5 categorizing tabs which feature generally useless avenues like “Radio.” Both the “For You” tab (which is a collection of music Apple puts together for you to listen to based on your streaming preferences)  and the “Browse Tab”, (which offers you random popular apple created playlists) are two separate tabs at the bottom of the app. Spotify holds their “For You” playlists and browse like features all under their “Homepage tab” which makes the content much easier and faster to consume as well.  <br>&emsp;&emsp;One of the most appealing things about Spotify are their personalized playlists. They offer, “Your Discover Weekly”, which appears on your homepage every week, and is a compilation of songs that you haven't heard yet, but suits your general streaming preferences and most likely will appeal to you. Along with other cool specialized playlists like release radar, Spotify also has the highly coveted “Daily Mix”. You are offered 6 daily mix playlists sorted into genres you like. For example, I have a pop daily mix, which is a Spotify made playlist of pop songs I play all the time and some pop songs I haven't heard yet that Spotify recommends to me. I have a “daily mix” that works the same way for r&b, hip hop and more. Apple recommends you music but it's definitely not as good or as convenient as Spotify curated playlists.  <br>&emsp;&emsp;My personal favorite thing about Spotify is their “End Of The Year Wrapped” playlists. Every year in December, Spotify shows you your streaming stats from the whole year. They tell you things like your minutes listened, top 5 artists you streamed, favorite genre and more. Specifically, I found out I listened to 33 thousand 909 minutes in 2018 and that my top streamed artist was Kanye West, among other stats. Finally, they make you a playlist with your top 100 songs of the year in order based on how many times you streamed them. Everyone loves this feature, because every December when it comes out, it trends on Twitter for the whole day and everyone compares their stats. It's very fun and just one way that Spotify is more personalized and the overall better app. If you're considering choosing a streaming platform, I wholeheartedly recommend Spotify."

        "text": "&emsp;&emsp;Streaming platforms are going to war right now. With cable slowly fading out, the cost of live cable is being funneled into the myriad of different streaming platforms and all their original series’. Here are my thoughts on some of the originals popping up on the competing platforms.  <br>&emsp;&emsp;Netflix and Hulu are the oldies on this list, but who said they aren’t still pumping out good, binge-worthy originals?  <br><br><b>Bojack Horseman (Netflix):</b><br>&emsp;&emsp;The first eight episodes of the final season of Bojack Horseman dropped on October 28th and I suggest you watch them all in one sitting. Unfamiliar with the series? It can be broken down pretty quickly. Washed up actor Bojack Horseman lives in Hollywoo and is dealing with a life of self-hatred and alcoholism that stems from his childhood. That’s pretty much it. But back to the new season. If you do happen to watch the whole thing at once, you will notice that by the seventh episode ninety percent of the plot lines have been wrapped up and it seems like the story ends happily with Horseman finally getting the help he needed and leaving to get a fresh start, and then you remember there will be more episodes dropping at the end of January. It’s a great fake out because fans familiar with the show are aware that this story will most likely not end happily as this show does not stray from telling the real story with real consequences for all your favorite characters. Time Magazine called the Netflix original “the most important animated series since The Simpson” and I couldn’t agree more. With a new set of perspectives introduced in the last episode, the question is will BoJack Horseman finally fall from his public pedestal in Hollywoo or will his actions continue to fall under the radar?  <br>&emsp;&emsp;<i>Bojack Horseman is available on Netflix. The first eight episodes of their sixth and final season are available for streaming now and the last eight will be available on January 31st, 2020.</i>  <br><br><b>Looking For Alaska (Hulu):</b>  <br>&emsp;&emsp;Based on John Green’s novel from 2005, Looking For Alaska, has been adapted for television and you gotta have tissues for this one. The story follows a group of friends at a boarding school, a prank war and a tragedy that affects them all, but most of all 16 year old Miles Halter. The show follows the story like a map, not straying much from the original. The performances are sub-par and match the tone of the show which to be honest is, bland. The soundtrack to the show is good music, but it's clear as you watch that they just don’t quite match. The penultimate episode of the series is clearly the strongest. The performances from the main characters work for a dramatized television version of grief. A standout moment from this heavier episode is the many scenes of The Colonel walk along the side of the road for what seems like days. I genuinely cannot tell if I enjoyed these moments or despised them because of how unrealistic it was for him to walk for days in an almost unconscious state without someone intervening. If you loved the book, I would honestly just stick with. In my opinion, the performances lacked the realness of being a teenager and the writing that wasn’t straight from the book was subpar.  <br>&emsp;&emsp;<i>Looking For Alaska is available on Hulu. All episodes of  Season 1 are streaming now.</i>  <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;With all the new streaming services coming up right now, Apple TV+ needed to distinguish themselves with stories that have strong performances and writing and they did not come up short.  <br><br><b>Dickinson (Apple TV+):</b>  <br>&emsp;&emsp;Based on the poetry and early life of American Emily Dickinson, Dickinson is a show for those who wants to a coming of age story that shows not only a woman’s struggle in the 1800s, but also the struggle of being a teen held back your parents. The first season follows Emily fighting to be taken seriously as a poet and trying to skirt her way around her mother’s aim of having her marry. The show balances her time period and our own by adding the occasional use of a “sick” or “pimp”, but also having Dickinson throw a rager with drops of opium as the drug of the night. While on the outside it might seem like a silly coming of age teen comedy, but the story tells a larger story of hiding pieces of yourself for others’ sake that really takes root when the nature of Emily and her best friend, Sue’s relationship is revealed. The third episode “Wild Nights” is fantastically written and acted by the entire cast, but specifically Ella Hunt who portrays Sue. Centered around a party thrown for the other teens of Amherst, the real story develops in the struggle between Emily and her brother and Sue’s soon to be husband, Austin and their fight for Sue’s attention. In the end, it becomes clear that Sue will never truly love Austin as deeply as she loves Emily.  I would be genuinely surprised if Hailee Stienfeld, who portrays Dickinson herself, and Hunt were not recognized for their incredibly real portrayal of these characters in the coming months of award shows. With the second season already in production, I am personally very excited to see where these characters will go after some of the cliffhangers left in the season finale.  <br>&emsp;&emsp;<i>Dickinson is available on Apple TV+. All episodes of Season 1 are available for streaming now.</i>  <br><br><b>The Morning Show (Apple TV+):</b>  <br>&emsp;&emsp;Another Apple TV+ show that I expect to see on this year’s nomination lists is The Morning Show. Starring award winning actresses Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston, it is loosely based on the real life event of Matt Lauer’s surprising expulsion from the Today Show after sexual misconduct allegations were filed against him. Alex Levy, The Morning Show host must move on and find a new co host after the expulsion of her partner of fifteen years, while also dealing with new management and her contract with the show hanging in the balance. The drama is witty and well-written, leaving you uncomfortable sometimes with the motivations behind their questionable actions. It is a real look inside the business and bustle of morning television which starts at an early 3:30 AM, as depicted in the first episode of the series. Witherspoon leaves you with a pit in your stomach during the series as she digs for more information and exemplifies the true meaning of being a journalist: going against the odds to find the truth for the public’s sake.<br>&emsp;&emsp;<i>The Morning Show is available on Apple TV+. Episodes 1-8 are now available. New episodes released on Fridays.</i>  <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;Disney+ is the youngest of them all, just opening the platform to the public on November 12th, but it is bringing the most to the table as it over 500 movie titles and hundreds of television shows available for streaming.  <br><br><b>High School Musical: The Musical: The Series (Disney+):</b> <br>&emsp;&emsp;One of the most controversial originals in their lineup is High School Musical: The Musical: The Series. Many were outraged by it possibly ruining the legacy Zac Efron and Vanessa Hudgens built over the course of the early 2000’s but I must say, after watching the pilot episode, I’m intrigued. Sure, it’s a bit cheesy with the love triangle between the main characters, but the main idea is just cheesy enough work. The show is a ten episode season, shot in a very similar style to NBC’s The Office, following the school’s production of High School Musical: The Musical at the high school where the movie was filmed. On a smaller scale, the show follows Nini, a theater geek with a new boyfriend, EJ who is quite literally the embodiment of Troy Bolton by the end of the third movie, and her ex-boyfriend Ricky who suggested a “break” while Nini went to theatre camp the summer before the start of the show. When Nini and EJ audition for Troy and Gabriella, Ricky regrets their “break” and auditions for Troy, stealing the chance at a showmance from EJ and Nini. While the show’s “Office” like filming style is funny, the writing is the funniest part of this show. It has you cringing at the right moments and screaming at the characters for their stupid hormonally influenced decisions. While some may have been worried about it tarnishing the first three movies, the show is taking its spot right next to them. The show is aware of pressure and takes it in stride by poking fun at the movies and just how ridiculous this whole thing while also succeeding to get me hooked to not only the story, but also the relationships. #TeamEJ<br>&emsp;&emsp;<i>High School Musical: The Musical: The Series is available on Disney+. New episodes are released every Friday.</i>  <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;Want us to cover any other movies or TV? Let us know on Instagram <b>@chs.newspaper</b>"

Unfortunately, a blazer and a Jurassic Park t-shirt do not provide the most protection from the frigid wind.  <br>&emsp;&emsp;The sun is being blocked by some ominous clouds which will likely begin to rain on us if we do not leave soon.

Two words that somehow have so much utter control over every choice it seems like they are the ones doing the decision-making.  <br>&emsp;&emsp;We’ve all faced it, the classic “what if” syndrome:  <br>&emsp;&emsp;There’s a risk you really want to take.  You think about it and think about it and endlessly think about it.  Your mind conjures up countless scenarios.  And eventually, you’re steered away from taking this chance because the fear and “what ifs” become uncontrollably overwhelming.  <br>&emsp;&emsp;Everything revolves around the probabilities of the simple question, “what if?”   From, “what if I fail?” to, “what if he says no?” to, “what if this bridge collapses?” There are an infinite number of “what ifs” that lead to the development of irrational fears often stopping us from taking the risks we want to.  Although undeniably, certain individuals are more likely to look past these “what ifs” and encounter risks with what seems like little fear.  <br>&emsp;&emsp;Amongst various factors that influence what type of risk-taker someone is, one main contributor is adolescence. The “what if” ideology that different individuals portray is influenced by various factors of early childhood ranging from protectiveness of parents to self-reliance at a young age.  By the time children become more independent and can make decisions on their own, their risk-taking behavior reflects these aspects of their childhood.  <br>&emsp;&emsp;The organization of risk-takers is not simple, a combination of basic personality traits, upbringing as an adolescent, and numerous other factors all play a significant role in how likely an individual is to take chances, ultimately causing a variety in people’s likeness to take risks.  <br>&emsp;&emsp;In 2012, the Proliance Center proposed one way to group people based on their willingness to take risks.  By classifying individuals relating on their likeness to take chances and participate in risky behavior, then organizing them into categories determined by these traits, the individuals are divided based on their “risk taker” type.  The eight categories, ranging from most risk-taking to least are as follows: Adventurous, Carefree, Composed, Spontaneous, Deliberate, Intense, Prudent, and Wary.  Each type is determined by a combination of personality traits that relate to enforcing risk factors in one’s life.  <br><br><b>Adventurous:</b> Congratulations, “what ifs?” don’t seem to phase you!  As the most impulsive and spontaneous of the group, risks are the thrill that give you energy to maintain that upbeat and energetic personality.  You often tend to seek out dangerous or bold activities in order to fulfill your need for constant excitement.  <br><br><b>Carefree:</b> You are the independent thinkers.  Taking risks fuels your eccentric persona and allows for your free-thought to flourish.  To you, the experiences gained from taking risks are far more valuable than the cost of any “what ifs.”  <br><br><b>Composed:</b> You are the diligent, goal oriented members of the group.  Although you prefer a steady environment, if taking risks fulfills your tasks, no “what ifs?” will stand in your way.  <br><br><b>Spontaneous:</b> Following your heart is what leads you to make most of your decisions.  In most cases, this is great, as you are an extremely passionate person that is always excited to have fun.  Although, your impulsiveness can be detrimental if risks are too hasty.  <br><br><b>Deliberate:</b> You are the planners. Constantly well prepared for any situation, you are not in fear of risks as you can easily adapt to remotely any situation.  <br><br><b>Intense:</b> Jam packed schedule?  Self-critical?  Extremely Passionate?  If you answered yes to the previous questions, you may be an Intense risk-taker.  You enjoy risks once in a while but that fear lurking from all that self critique tends to steer you away from taking too many.  <br><br><b>Prudent:</b> You.do.not.like.change.  That said, risks...not something you’re a big fan of.  However, once in a while you enjoy a bit of spontaneity to stir things up, as long as it doesn’t disrupt anything major.  <br><br><b>Wary:</b> Remember the raging pessimist mentioned earlier?  That my friend, is you.  Afraid of any risks and changes, you enjoy traditional customs.  The “what ifs” seem overwhelming when you are faced with any situation that could lead to a result altering your life, causing you to avoid risks at any cost.  <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;Personalities shape to what extent one is comfortable taking risks. From minor risks like hitting the snooze button on your alarm clock an extra time, or spending a few dollars on the lottery, or winging a test you probably should've studied for, we take countless chances every day that don’t even realize are risks.  So even if you are a Wary risk-taker, technically you are taking far more risks than you may like to think, but these seemingly insignificant risks add a little extra thrill to each day of our lives.  <br>&emsp;&emsp;As the world continues to change around us, with new technology and ideas flourishing, the availability of high consequence risks increases.  Whether you are Wary or Adventurous, endless possibilities are out there with only more to come.  So scratch the “what ifs” and take that risk, because no matter what type of risk-taker you are, everyone needs a little thrill in their lives once in a while. "

        "text": "&emsp;&emsp;I believe in an internal and external force that connects us all as humans. And no, I’m not talking about some religious spirit, I’m talking about something that <b>each and every one of us experiences regardless of race or religion; laughter</b>. But what really is laughter? To me, laughter is a <b>unique</b> way that our species <b>expresses humor</b>. However, Webster’s dictionary states that to laugh means to “make the spontaneous sounds and movements of the face and body that are the instinctive expressions of lively amusement and sometimes also of contempt or derision. Now I know what you’re thinking, “that sounds like the most lifeless thing I’ve ever heard.” Believe me, there’s way more to laughter than just moving your face.  <br>&emsp;&emsp;According to copious sources, laughter is a verb. Personally, I consider laughter a <b>feeling</b>. It’s a feeling when you’re sitting in class and your buddy next to you cracks the funniest joke you’ve heard all day. It’s that specific feeling of suppression when you have to <b>hold all of that emotion down and try so hard not to just laugh</b> like the hysterical maniac you are. <b>It’s that feeling that gets the adrenaline in your blood flowing, veins pumping like you feel as though your life is absolutely perfect.</b> You feel as though nothing at that moment could possibly ruin it and that is exactly the moments we aim to recreate.  <br>&emsp;&emsp;Now I know that at least one person reading this will be scanning the page for the word <b>drug</b> again and now you’ve come to the right place. Laughter isn’t a drug per se, but it has many similar qualities to it. First of all, it’s addicting like anything you’ve ever experienced. We’ve all had those moments where <b>we just have wasted minutes laughing</b> at some stupid thing that wasn’t even that funny.  It’s not your fault, once you start, you can’t stop. It’s basically the world’s first completely harmless (and <b>FREE</b>) drug. When I’m laughing, I feel like all of my problems have temporarily disappeared out of the blue. Now laughter can also be compared to the drugs of the medical world as well. Sometimes all a person needs to feel better is a simple little knock-knock joke. Just getting the laughter out of someone that is in a bad mood can boost their spirits and yours as well.  To some people, laughter is the world’s <b>best</b> medicine.  <br>&emsp;&emsp;Sometimes, laughter isn’t just fun and games (although most of the time it is) it could be the start of something <b>lifelong such as a relationship or an inseparable friendship</b>. Usually, either one of these two starts by just finding something that you have in common to laugh at with one another. Various friendships of mine started out with hearing the two simultaneous giggles across the room. That moment you look at one another you know that your relationship with that person has changed <b>forever</b>. Laughter is <b>the essence that connects two souls together, binding them with the power of humor</b>.  <br>&emsp;&emsp;I believe that laughter is the only type of pain that I enjoy. That feeling when <b>your face is sore, your stomach hurts, your eyes are watering, and when you have trouble breathing and finding that half-second between shouts of amusement, only to laugh some more.</b>  Laughter, itself is <b>its own language</b>, connecting people regardless of differences by showing them that they can enjoy the same thing. Personally, some of my most unforgettable memories have just been me, my friends, and my family, just absolutely <b>bursting with laughter and having the time of our lives</b>. I believe that laughter is a crucial necessity in our everyday lives.  <br>&emsp;&emsp;<b>I believe in laughter.</b>"

        "text": "&emsp;&emsp;At birth, you are given a name.  Maybe your parents found a good one in a book or on a list, or maybe they name you to honor a favorite fictional character.  Or maybe they choose to name you after a family member whom they wish to honor.  When this title is bestowed upon you, so are all the incarnations of this name from the past.  <br>&emsp;&emsp;In the Bible, there are three main Joseph’s.  The first was sold into slavery by his jealous brothers but eventually rose to be the right hand man of the Egyptian pharaoh.  The next was the Earthly father of Jesus, the one who taught him what it means to be human and how to run the family.  The third made his mark on the world by paying for the tomb for Jesus to be buried in after the crucifixion.  More recently, both of my grandfathers have a middle name of Joseph.  <br>&emsp;&emsp;Once you are out in the world, your name is your identification, but it is not chosen for you.  It is the choice of your parents to assign your name to you.  Your name is the official representation of this new ray of sunshine in their world that has so much potential to do what your parents can merely dream of.  It encompasses their hopes for your future based on your namesakes and their wants to give their child the best life they can.  <br>&emsp;&emsp;At church, I was always introduced as Joseph.  In preschool, I was Joseph.  At home, my parents referred to me as Joseph.  This was my name when I was 1, 2, 3, and 4, and it fit.  <br>&emsp;&emsp;As you get older, your identity changes on the whole.  You learn new things, your mannerisms change, and you mature.  You also begin to think for yourself.  As you continue to get older, but everyone from the people at church to your aunts and uncles continues to refer to you in the same patronizing tone all young children are referred to as, you might begin to resent the name which is now attached to your childhood.  As you become older still, and your future becomes a topic of discussion, you realize that you are held to the standards of your namesake; your parents want your future to be just as bright and impactful as the giants who held your name before.  <br>&emsp;&emsp;I dealt with much of this until about high school.  The friends of my parents referred to me as Joseph the little kid who’s so tall now.  The people in church knew Joseph.  My family still called me Joseph.  However, as I got a lot older, I outgrew my name like I did my pants.  My parents started shortening it to Joe as we were able to develop a real relationship.  My friends all abbreviated it to Joe.  And at school, as my confidence in myself grew stronger, I was able to shed three letters and become Joe.  <br>&emsp;&emsp;As Joe, I am intelligent and athletic.  As Joe, I am free to make decisions about my life and what I want to be.  When I am older, and the news report turns to its meteorologist, the title card will not read Joseph.  I will be freed from that name.  Joe Vitali will be a meteorologist.  <br>&emsp;&emsp;Joseph, on the other hand, will be weighed down by his responsibilities.  Joseph cannot be himself, and will be judged by the ancient standards of 3 Joseph’s who were able to make a name for themselves in the most popular book in the world.  Those Joseph’s did something significant in their lives, so Joseph must live to do things as great as the legends.  But not Joe.  I am proud to say that I am free from this burden.  <br>&emsp;&emsp;Since you are defined by your name, don’t get trapped in life by the expectations surrounding your name.  Nicknames may be “informal,” but they can make your life easier.  You have the power to change your name if you want to.  Be free."

        "text": "&emsp;&emsp;What’s your sign? I’m sure you’ve been asked this before and it’s very likely that you know the answer. Astrology is a pseudoscience and technically is not real. However, it can feel scarily accurate at times; except when it’s not. Have you ever read a description of your sign and not identified with it at all? This happens to loads of people and I am here today to give you one explanation as to why this happens. The question “what’s your sign” doesn’t have to result in a one-word answer. If you’re born in August, you’re likely to answer, “Leo”, but that one sign is not the only one you have. That one sign is actually called your sun sign and while it is the most important we still have others. Everyone’s birth chart is unique and is not only based on the month and day you were born but also the time and location you were born at.  Astrology is extremely complicated but to make this explanation easier, let’s create a theoretical person and explain their chart (we’ll name her Jill).  <br>&emsp;&emsp;Jill was born on April 10th, 2003 at 3:19am in Buffalo New York. This makes her an Aries sun, Cancer moon, Taurus Mercury, Pisces venus, Capricorn mars, Leo Jupiter, Gemini Saturn, Pisces Uranus, Aquarius Neptune, and Sagittarius Pluto. Yes, that’s a lot, I know. That’s not even everything! There is a lot that goes into astrology but a good place to start is with the big three.  <br>&emsp;&emsp;What are the big three? Your big three are your sun, moon, and rising (or ascendant) signs. They are the most important and can help you understand who a person really is.  <br>&emsp;&emsp;Your sun sign describes you at your core, it explains your defining characteristics. Your sun sign is your personality. Because Jill’s sun sign is Aries, she is direct and straightforward with what she wants. She is independent and lives in the now, always ready to accept a challenge. some negatives to an Aries sun are arrogance and having a temper. Think about your friends born in April, are they especially bold and/or aggressive often?  <br>&emsp;&emsp;My favorite way to explain what your rising sign means is that it’s how you act at a party. Your ascendant is how you appear in social situations. Jill is a Capricorn rising. This makes her analytical and can dampen down her bold fiery personality if you’ve just met her. She is careful and controlled in her boldness.  <br>&emsp;&emsp;Jill’s moon is in cancer and that along with her sun and rising sign make up her big three. The moon represents our emotions and how we act when comfortable in our element or at home. Jill’s Cancer moon makes her empathetic but also clingy, and she is great at remembering emotional times in her past. This often leads to dwelling on past wrongdoings yet she won’t confront anyone about them. Instead, she finds passive ways to get your attention, which can take a turn into manipulation. She will take care of the ones she loves but she is extremely sensitive and moody, which may be part of the reason cancers are represented by the crab.  <br>&emsp;&emsp;You may have noticed that a few of the traits I mentioned are contradictory. Jill is straightforward yet passive at the same time? We ourselves as humans are contradictory so it does make sense. In some situations we are bold yet in others we are timid. It all depends on the surrounding factors. Even if you don’t believe in astrology, even the tiniest bit,  it can still be fun and worth reading upon. What I wrote about above is only scratching the surface, astrology goes much much deeper and would take me a book, or two, to explain it all."

        "tags": "michael jordan lebron james sports basketball",
        "text": "&emsp;&emsp;Debates are a central part of our culture. People argue over issues that have significant relevance to our day to day lives, like how to solve health care or who a better presidential candidate is. But there is one question that transcends the rest: Jordan or LeBron?<br>&emsp;&emsp;With LeBron James winning his 4th NBA title and his 4th Finals MVP, the debate over who the greatest player of all time has gained some steam. Lebron James is one of the best players in today’s league. Just this year, he came second in MVP voting, averaging 25.3 points per game, 7.8 assists per game, and 10.2 assists per game. His career stats are even more impressive: 27.1 points per game,  7.4 assists per game, 7.4 rebounds per game, and 1.6 steals per game.  In addition to that, next year will be his 18th year in the league, just 4 seasons short of having the longest career in NBA history. And because he only has a handful of years left, James’s Legacy has come into question. It’s one of the best of all time, without a doubt. But is it the best? <br>&emsp;&emsp;Michael Jordan’s name is synonymous with being the best. He has gone 6 for 6 in the finals, earned 5 MVPs and 6 Finals MVPs, and 10 scoring titles. Like Bill Russel and Kareem Abdul Jabar, a few have surpassed Jordan’s total MVPs and championships won. Still, the stark differences from their eras (like having no 3 point line,  fewer fouls, and fewer stats recorded) prevent accurate comparisons. However, this doesn’t mean that Jordan was a great basketball player because of technicalities. He averaged 30.1 points per game, 6.2 rebounds per game, 5.3 assists per game, and 2.3 steals per game. He was the league leader in steals per game for 3 consecutive years, and he’s been a Defensive Player of the Year. As of today, LeBron has surpassed Jordan in quite a few of his achievements, including  Most NBA finals played (6 games by Jordan to 10 by LeBron). So, Should Jordan still be considered the greatest?<br>&emsp;&emsp;Stats-wise, it’s not as apparent as one might think. Throughout his whole career, Jordan averages one more 3-pointer per game than LeBron, and 0.7 more steals than LeBron. James has about 2 more assists and an extra rebound per game. The two players both average 0.8 blocks per game, and taking into account points off assists, LeBron barely has the edge over Jordan (40.7 to 41.9). Career stats are not as valuable as stats from the best playoffs player has had. After-all, Lebron and Jordan were both significantly better after their rookie years, and Jordan’s last few years were lackluster compared to his years on the Bulls. When championships are on the line, one can clearly see the best version of an athlete. Using those numbers, Jordan pulls ahead of Lebron. His all-time highest points in a playoff game is almost 9 points more than LeBron’s best ( 43.7 to 35.3). Moreover,  Jordan averaged more blocks and steals per game. Jordan was better on both ends of the court compared to Lebron. So the answer is clear, right?<br>&emsp;&emsp;At this point, fans of LeBron will point out that James has gone to the finals more times than any other player in history. He’s also been a more impactful player to the team, leading a Cavs team to the finals in 2009 without another all-star player. In the years he left the Cavs (2011 and 2019), the team went from Top 5 in the Eastern Conference to the Eastern Conference’s bottom 5. When Jordan left the Bulls in 1994, the team still made it to the Conference finals. And that’s the biggest difference between the two players. While Jordan has always had a reliable team behind him, LeBron has had to account for a Basketball team’s niches on his own. Jordan played with Scottie Pippen, Steve Kerr, Dennis Rodman, and the greatest coach of all time,  Phil Jackson. He had a well-oiled machine running behind him. On the other hand, LeBron has gone to three different teams in his career and played with multiple coaches. While LeBron has only won 60% of his finals match-ups, Jordan has won 100% of his.  LeBron’s career started in 2003, exactly when Jordan left the league. And because of that, he always had to bear more criticism than his predecessor, despite different circumstances. Today, the standard for being the best player of all time remains Jordan. The number of Championships a player has, the stats a player averages per game, and the accolades a player earns are almost always compared to Jordan’s numbers. For LeBron to be considered the best player, he needs to be the new standard of comparison, with more championships, MVPs, and points per game than Jordan. But until then, Jordan remains on top, and LeBron is second best. "

        "text": "&emsp;&emsp;October 18, 2019, <i>Zombieland: Double Tap</i> was released to theaters. Written by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, this hilarious movie has returned with the familiar actors; Jesse Eisinberg, Emma Stone, Abigail Breslin, and Woody Harrelson. The story line wasn't predictable, but I liked how they continued to build the characters. Towards the end, all the characters had accomplished meaningful goals for themselves and it ended the story very well.  <br>&emsp;&emsp;In the sequel to <i>Zombieland</i> the gang is together, living in the white house. Life is bliss but the adventurous charisma that all the characters share eventually leads to exploring outside of the home they've made. Columbus’ proposal to Wichita led her to react based on  commitment issues she had developed which then led to her and Little Rock taking off in the middle of the night. Crushed by their disappearance, Tallahassee and Columbus planned to move out of the white house to look for adventure. Ironically, Little Rock had left Wichita for a dreamy boy they had met while traveling. To find her, Wichita returned to Tallahassee and Columbus for help. This quest to assure Little Rocks safety was in all of the characters interest and once again the plot now had a paramount issue to resolve. With the help of others that the three met on their quest, the gang was finally reunited with everyone's safety assured.  <br>&emsp;&emsp;I was satisfied to watch a movie that had so much comedy yet was original and didnt feel cliché. The continued theme used throughout both of the movies connected the dots of the timeline between the two and made it feel smooth without any important details moving, for example; columbus’ rules. The rules he makes are an important part of his character and major events in the movie can be traced back to why he made them. I also like the theme that Tallahassee pursued, which was his love for the King; aka Elivs Presly. It connects him to his childhood which he can use to mentally feel safe and it leads him to what he truly wants. Throughout the movie he's determined to “venture freely” but his passion for the King leads him to find what he was actually looking for; a family. Besides the character development that the writers create, they also create just a really good story that's entertaining and relatable to. I would say iIf you were looking for a good movie to enjoy, the one about friends surviving together as they blow up zombie brains is a great start."
