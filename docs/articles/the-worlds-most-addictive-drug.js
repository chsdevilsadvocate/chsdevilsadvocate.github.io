> I believe in an internal and external force that connects us all as humans. And no, I’m not talking about some religious spirit, I’m talking about something that **each and every one of us experiences regardless of race or religion; laughter**. But what really is laughter? To me, laughter is a **unique** way that our species **expresses humor**. However, Webster’s dictionary states that to laugh means to “make the spontaneous sounds and movements of the face and body that are the instinctive expressions of lively amusement and sometimes also of contempt or derision. Now I know what you’re thinking, “that sounds like the most lifeless thing I’ve ever heard.” Believe me, there’s way more to laughter than just moving your face.
> According to copious sources, laughter is a verb. Personally, I consider laughter a **feeling**. It’s a feeling when you’re sitting in class and your buddy next to you cracks the funniest joke you’ve heard all day. It’s that specific feeling of suppression when you have to **hold all of that emotion down and try so hard not to just laugh** like the hysterical maniac you are. **It’s that feeling that gets the adrenaline in your blood flowing, veins pumping like you feel as though your life is absolutely perfect.** You feel as though nothing at that moment could possibly ruin it and that is exactly the moments we aim to recreate.
> Now I know that at least one person reading this will be scanning the page for the word **drug** again and now you’ve come to the right place. Laughter isn’t a drug per se, but it has many similar qualities to it. First of all, it’s addicting like anything you’ve ever experienced. We’ve all had those moments where **we just have wasted minutes laughing** at some stupid thing that wasn’t even that funny.  It’s not your fault, once you start, you can’t stop. It’s basically the world’s first completely harmless (and **FREE**) drug. When I’m laughing, I feel like all of my problems have temporarily disappeared out of the blue. Now laughter can also be compared to the drugs of the medical world as well. Sometimes all a person needs to feel better is a simple little knock-knock joke. Just getting the laughter out of someone that is in a bad mood can boost their spirits and yours as well.  To some people, laughter is the world’s **best** medicine.
> Sometimes, laughter isn’t just fun and games (although most of the time it is) it could be the start of something **lifelong such as a relationship or an inseparable friendship**. Usually, either one of these two starts by just finding something that you have in common to laugh at with one another. Various friendships of mine started out with hearing the two simultaneous giggles across the room. That moment you look at one another you know that your relationship with that person has changed **forever**. Laughter is **the essence that connects two souls together, binding them with the power of humor**.  
> I believe that laughter is the only type of pain that I enjoy. That feeling when **your face is sore, your stomach hurts, your eyes are watering, and when you have trouble breathing and finding that half-second between shouts of amusement, only to laugh some more.**  Laughter, itself is **its own language**, connecting people regardless of differences by showing them that they can enjoy the same thing. Personally, some of my most unforgettable memories have just been me, my friends, and my family, just absolutely **bursting with laughter and having the time of our lives**. I believe that laughter is a crucial necessity in our everyday lives.
> **I believe in laughter.**
