> If you’re anything like me, you love Christmas. That includes Christmas songs. However, what I can’t stand is people playing Christmas songs MONTHS before Christmas. I’m talking August - October. As the season approaches, I am starting to prepare myself for the explosion of Christmas. Which includes the overplaying of the same Christmas songs. Those songs also happen to be the same ones that people play months before Christmas, which I have a problem with. I can handle watching all of the movies repeatedly and seeing all of the decorations, in fact I like looking at the decorations, but Christmas songs before Thanksgiving is where I draw the line on my holiday spirit. Of course I know people in my own family that would listen to these songs all year round and would strongly argue with me about my opinions. I can’t even hide from these songs in my own house, but I will not let myself enjoy them until after Thanksgiving. Some people may call me a “Scrooge” or a “Grinch”, but I have never said “Bah Humbug”or “I hate Christmas”. It's just that I prefer to listen and enjoy them closer to Christmas, like December, when I can look at the tree and take it all in. 
> Below is a list of the Top 10 Christmas songs that, in MY OPINION, are overplayed, but depending on what your view is, this could be a list of the Top 10 Best Christmas Songs. These are not ranked in any order. 
> Disclaimer: I don’t have anything against these songs, it just annoys me when the same song is played over and over and over again on the radio and in my house and by my friends.
